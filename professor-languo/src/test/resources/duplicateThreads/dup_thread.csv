2133	Turning a differential drive robot to a specific angle	"<p>Given a robot with 2 wheels with radius r on one axle with length D, I want to set the wheel speed so that it turns to an angle phi as fast as possible. The timestep t is 64 milliseconds.</p>

<p>I thought the wheel speed could be set to v = ((desired_heading-actual_heading) * circumference_wheel_trajectory)/(2*pi * t * wheel_radius). This will converge to a somewhat right angle, eventually, but its very slow and becomes slower as I approach the angle I want to be at.</p>

<p>Is there an alternative/better way to do this?</p>

4750	PID Control Tuning	"<p>Im currently designing a robot for my undergraduate project. One of the task of this robot is to follow the wall. For the purpose I'm using a PID control system, where the reference is given from a ultrasonic sensor. So my problem here is im having a hard time tuning the PID. I know i can find the P coefficient pretty easily by plotting the desired set point range vs desired motor output speed. Even then the robot is not so stable, so i though of adding DI part of PID. But how do find out roughly the values of these coefficients without just trying out random values (manual tuning)? Thank you so much. Much appreciated.</p>

2321	Tracking 2D positioning with IMU Sensor	"<p>I am using a miniature car and I want to estimate the position. We can not use GPS modules and most of the tracking systems that I saw, are using IMU senson with the GPS module. In our car we are able to find our exact correct location with image processing but for some parts that dont have enough markings we can not do this. So we want to use the IMU as backup for our positioning. so as long as the positioning is close is good for us.</p>

<p>And we are only interested in our 2D position since the car is on a flat ground.</p>

<p>I am using a IMU 9DOF sensor and I want to calculate my movement. I have seen some amazing works with IMU for tracking body movements but no code or simple explanation is anywhere about it. So basically I have the reading from accelerometer, gyro and magnetometer. I also have orientation in quarternions. From the device I am getting also the linear acceleration but even when I am not moving it in any direction the values are not 0 which is really confusing.</p>

<p>Can you please help me how to approach this?</p>

1174	PID tuning to make my balancing robot better	"<p>See the video below of my balancing robot.<br>
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjp8yoTVUcY"" rel=""nofollow"">Balancing robot</a></p>

<p>I was having trouble getting it to balance on hard surfaces but finally got it after playing with the PID gains a lot.  Previously it was balancing just fine on carpet.  </p>

<p>I set the PID gains by just picking a Kp, then increasing Ki until the robot oscillated very badly and tried to smash it's self into the ground,  then increasing Kd until it was finally stable. Here's the gains I'm using in the video.</p>

<pre><code>  Kp=20, Ki=4.5, Kd=45;
</code></pre>

<p>It will sit in one spot balancing without any problem.  You can see in the video that it can even stop from falling after I give it a pretty good kick.  The problem is that it stops from falling over but then greatly overshoots the other direction.  In the video you can see when I give it just a small tap it runs the other way for a while before finally becoming stable again.  </p>

<p>Any suggestions on what to try next?</p>

1175	Minimum speed controller refresh rate	"<p>In a quadrotor we need to change each motor's speed depends on its position in space. More frequency will result more stability ( I mean if we can change motor's speed 400 times per second instead of 100 times per second we may stabilize our UAV quadrotor far better ).</p>

<p>Now my question targeting people who made a UAV quadrotor before or have any information about ESCs. I wanna know whats the minimum refresh rate for ESCs in a quadrotor to make it stable ? For example may an ESC with 50hz refresh rate enough for stabilizing quadrotor or not ? I'm asking this question because high speed ESCs are more expensive than lower speed ones.</p>

4820	Choosing motor characteristics	"<p>I have just sized the DC motors I want to use (corresponding to my robot and its intended applications - my figures include a 50% uncertainty factor to account for friction in reducers and other losses). Now I need to actually choose the exact motors I want to buy from the manufacturer (I am targeting maxon motors as I am not an expert and want no problem). I have a few down to earth questions about linking the mechanical needs to the electrical characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maxon states a ""nominal voltage"" in the characteristic sheets. Is that the voltage you should apply to the motor? This may be a dumb question but I have followed the full maxon e-learning course and read about other tutorials on the web and I could not find this information anywhere. Can anyone who knows about motors confirm?</li>
<li>As far as I understand, the nominal torque corresponds to the maximum torque the motor can sustain continuously. So I guess, as a rule of thumb, I should find a motor with a nominal torque = my max torque (after reduction), or around. Right?</li>
<li>Also I chose a motor reference (310005 <a href=""http://www.maxonmotor.com/maxon/view/catalog/"" rel=""nofollow"">found here</a>) which has a stated power of 60W, as the nominal voltage is 12V, I was expecting to have a nominal current of 5A, but it states 4A. Where am I wrong?</li>
<li>The motor I chose has nominal speed = 7630rpm - nominal torque = 51.6mNm. My needs are max speed = 50.42rpm / max torque = 10620 mNm. This means a reduction factor of 151 for speed and 206 for torque. Should I choose a gear closer to 151 or 206?</li>
<li>What is the ""rated torque"" mentioned when choosing a gear? I know my input torque (torque on the motor side) and my output torque (torque on the system side), does that correspond to any of these two?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have followed some theoretical and practical courses on the web but I find it hard to find answers to my down to earth question...</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

2234	Zero crossing events in trapezoidal commutation	"<p>I would like to ask a question about zero crossing event in a trapezoidal commutation on a brush-less DC motor. Here is the waveform that shows that the zero crossing event occurs every 180 electrical degrees in a sinusoidal commutation:<br> <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lcZrH.png"" alt=""sinusoidal""></p>

<p>But what about trapezoidal commutation. Here is the waveform that I found about the trapezoidal commutation: <br><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jIez1.png"" alt=""trapezoidal""></p>

<p>So as you see, the zero crossing occurs 30 electrical degrees after the previous commutation and 30 electrical degrees before the next commutation.
In a motor with one pole pair, we would have 30 electrical degrees = 30 mechanical degrees, so we would have this waveform: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/T5BCZ.png"" alt=""zero crossing"">
You see that the zero crossing in phase A occurs when the magnet faces the phase C, or in other words, after 30 electrical degrees from the last commutation.
My question in why does the zero crossing happen at that moment, why not after 60 electrical degrees, or 15 electrical degrees?
Is it related to some law's of induction? What are those law and how do this law's appear in this motor?
Can someone explain to me this with some pics?</p>

1552	Use of automated tricopters instead of quadcopters?	"<p>Hy, I just found useful to post my idea here. </p>

<p>I've seen videos about automated quadcopters: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/raffaello_d_andrea_the_astounding_athletic_power_of_quadcopters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/raffaello_d_andrea_the_astounding_athletic_power_of_quadcopters.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/vijay_kumar_robots_that_fly_and_cooperate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/vijay_kumar_robots_that_fly_and_cooperate.html</a>. </p>

<p>I surfed pages from the companies presenting this research and other information on the internet, but I haven't found why they use quadcopters specifically. 
I understand, how accelerating, rotating and rolling works in those quadcopters - it's simple, but they claim that quadcopters have minimum number of working parts to fulfill their needs, which I don't agree and I think that tricopters are better in this (duocopters can't rotate horizontally, but tricopters can by inclining and then powering the remaining left or right propeller). </p>

<p>I rode forums, calculated and draw drafts of both tri and quad and found, that tri is much more efficient just in everything than quad with same props and battery when taken in account that best properties has the smallest copter with the largest props so: 
3:4 moving parts (no vectored yaw in tri), 9.5:16 size, building Y instead of X construction take far less material 1.5:2.82, lesser maximum power input 3:4, better power efficiency makes longer flight time and tricopters have also improved agility over quadcopters. </p>

<p>The only disadvantage I see is a bit complicated horizontal rotating in tricopter without vectored yaw, which can be problem in man controlled machines but easily solved by simple algorithms in automated machines -> it's not a real disadvantage, just a small work to be done. I was thinking about doing that in my bachelor thesis, but for now I am looking for your opinions, thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: Maybe the torque is the problem, because on tricopters you can can have all 3 props in 1 direction or 2 in 1 direction and 1 in the opposite and it's symmetrical in neither way, but I'm not sure if this is the main problem...</p>
