<p>Somerset Maugham's <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/222/222-h/222-h.htm""><em>The Moon and Sixpence</em></a> contains an unusual (perhaps even unique) usage of English that I'm hoping some native speaker can shed light on. Here is the sentence in bold, with some surrounding sentences for context. Dirk Stroeve has previously been described as ""a painter, but a very bad one"". The narrator says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the evenings I went to see my
  friends.  I looked in often on the
  Stroeves, and sometimes shared their
  modest fare.  Dirk Stroeve flattered
  himself on his skill in cooking
  Italian dishes, and <strong>I confess that
  his <i>spaghetti</i> were very much
  better than his pictures.</strong>  It was a
  dinner for a King when he brought in a
  huge dish of it, succulent with
  tomatoes, and we ate it together with
  the good household bread and a bottle
  of red wine.  I grew more intimate
  with Blanche Stroeve…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since <em>spaghetti</em> is (almost?) always used in English in the singular as an uncountable (mass) noun, this is unusual. What is the right interpretation of this sentence?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""His spaghetti"" is parallel to ""his omelettes"". That is, it refers to the many occasions he cooked spaghetti, and means something like ""his <em>spaghetti dishes</em> were better than his pictures"". (The OED entry for 'spaghetti' has <em>""1. a. A variety of pasta made in long thin strings. Occas., a dish of spaghetti.""</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>As in the original <a href=""http://ljkrakauer.com/LJK/essays/biscottibis.htm"">Italian usage</a>, ""spaghetti"" in the plural here refers to multiple strands of spaghetti or pieces of spaghetti.</p></li>
<li><p>Something else.</p></li>

<p>Well, the question is in the title. I always had the impression that ""talk to someone"" refers to situations when some information must be conveyed to someone else, while ""talk with someone"" refers to cases that involve a more complex two-sided interaction. E.g., I ""talk to my colleague"" to tell him that I'm going for a lunch break (no response is required apart from maybe an acknowledgment), while I go and ""talk with my colleague"" if I have to discuss something with him in detail.

<p>The <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/q/4510/1720"">Why is ""cannot"" spelled as one word?</a> post brought back another oddity I noticed when learning English. The contraction <em>won't</em> seems to break a common pattern in similar contractions:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>cannot</em> => <em>can't</em></li>
<li><em>do not</em> => <em>don't</em></li>
<li><em>should not</em> => <em>shouldn't</em></li>
<li><em>would not</em> => <em>wouldn't</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In these examples, the <em>o</em> sound in <em>not</em> is dropped and the letter <em>o</em> (<em>no</em> in the case of <em>cannot</em>) is replaced with an apostrophe.</p>

<p>However, <em>will not</em> => <em>won't</em> drops <em>ill</em> from <em>will</em> and replaces it with the <em>o</em> from <em>not</em>. This contraction is probably derived from shifts in speech rather than writing. How did the contraction <em>won't</em> emerge?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is better to compare with other pronouns.</p>

<p>Its is substantially different in form than other genitive pronouns, in that it appears to be a relatively modern construction (OED has the earliest attested use in the 15th century) which in fact generalizes from the apostrophe possessive, or is a result of the same transformation that produced the apostrophe from OE strong|singular|masc./neut. -es. ""Him""->""his"" definitely isn't generalized from a widely attested grammatical rule; they've been in the language from old english essentially unchanged. By the logic that ""its"" operates similarly to other pronouns one would expect its (its' ?) modern form to be something like ""his"" which was its' original genitive form.</p>

  <p>A. Yes, that’s a good system. Sometimes it’s helpful to repeat the full name in later 
  chapters as a reminder. Occasionally, too, it makes sense to use the
  acronym first and put the full name in parentheses, if the acronym in

<p>So we've all heard the admonishments from our teachers not to end a clause with a preposition</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A plumber visits a wealthy estate to fix a clogged toilet. As the butler opens the door, the plumber barks out,""I'm here to fix the toilet. Where's your bathroom at?""</p>
  
  <p>""Please try to speak with more discretion. We do not want to disturb our neighbors with the details of our plumbing issues. And we most certainly do not end our sentences with prepositions, sir.</p>
  
  <p>So the plumber lowers his tone and says more cordially, ""I'm here to fix the toilet. Where's your bathroom at, asshole.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, back to the matter at hand. I have come under the impression that this is a rule of thumb to help the elementary student avoid mismatching case for the target of the preposition rather than a hard rule. For example by placing the preposition closer to its target, you avoid constructs like: ""Who did you give the invitation to?"" instead of the proper ""To whom did you give the invitation?"". Moving the preposition closer makes the incorrect case sound absurd. No one would ever say ""To who did you give the invitation?""</p>

<p>All of this introductory text leads up to this simple question: Is this phrase correct ""Whom did you give the invitation to?"" or is it still incorrect english even though we addressed the issue of case?</p>

133248	What do we call the tenses?	"<p>When I was at school, well over half a century ago, it was the study of Latin which introduced me to the idea of tenses. Our Latin master carefully segregated the six indicative tenses into two groups: </p>

<ol>
<li>The first three were called Present, Imperfect, Future.</li>
<li>The second three, or compound tenses were Perfect, Pluperfect and Future Perfect.</li>
</ol>

<p>I still call the English tenses by those names. However in English there is a simple past tense  (I ran, he spoke) which is not the case in Latin. Similarly in French there is the Past Historic, but which is only used in formal writing. </p>

<p>So as far as I'm concerned the English tenses are 'present, past, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect as follows:</p>

<p>Present -       I help, I run, I have  or I am helping, I am running, I am having.</p>

<p>Past -        I helped, I ran, I had</p>

<p>Imperfect -   I was helping, I was running, I was having</p>

<p>Future  -     I will help, I will run, I will have or I shall help etc</p>

<p>Perfect  -    I have helped, I have run, I have had  (Past par'ciple) helped, run, had</p>

<p>Pluperfect-   I had helped, I had run, I had had. (e,g I had had my breakfast by the time he arrived.</p>

<p>Future Perfect - I shall have helped, I shall have run, I shall have had (e.g. I shall have run ten miles before she starts)     </p>

<p>But I note that my children, as well as many here refer to the present perfect, and the past perfect. Presumably these are what I would have called the perfect and the pluperfect respectively. Is that right?  </p>

<p>On some forum today I referred to myself as <em>a English nerd</em>. Now I'm wondering whether maybe I'm <em>an English nerd</em>.</p>

<p>My gut feeling tells me that there is a slight nuance in meaning between the two phrases and that even though the general rule is to use <em>an</em> in front of a word starting with a vowel, I think <em>a</em> is more appropriate in this case.</p>

<p>The <em>a</em> in <em>a English nerd</em> refers to the word <em>nerd</em> and the adjective is only added to denote the type of nerd that I am.</p>

<p>Whereas using the phrasing <em>an English nerd</em> would imply that I am a nerd who happens to be English (I'm not).</p>

<p>Now, my question is: Did I analyze this correctly and is there in fact a nuance in meaning? Or should I have used <em>an English nerd</em> to comply with the general ""a versus an"" rule?</p>

<p>Without listing words, if you can think of the first ten swear words that come to mind, they will almost invariably contain hard-ts, hard-ks, hard-gs, etc. Even if they're not in English, this is the norm. I've found there are less examples of fricatives/plosives in French profanity, however.</p>

<p>What is the psychology behind fricatives? Are some words offensive strictly because of meaning or also because of linguistics? When we hear a fricative, does our brain have some inclination to believe it's profane? If I make up some fake words containing fricatives, some of them potentially sound obscene, but this is a subjective test.</p>

<p>Obscenities do change over time, with new words coming about quite often, but they almost invariably contain fricatives. Why is this?</p>

156253	AE vs British English usage of hospital	"<p>We all know that Americans say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sara is going to the hospital</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While in the UK, they would say (and Americans would <em>never</em> say):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sara is going to hospital</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm wondering what the history of this difference is given that in AE, the usage of the ""the"" modifier seems extraordinarily arbitrary: Americans would say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sara is going to school</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to mean that Sara is going to <em>be enrolled in school</em>. While they would say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sara is going to the school</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to mean that Sara is going a particular school building (not enrolled).</p>

<p>To me this intuitively suggests some sort of lack of ""personal"" connection with the concept of a hospital which is not there when it comes to concepts like ""school"" or ""church"". </p>

<p>Now for the leap: does this perhaps have anything to do that in the US, healthcare has been a private entity (until recent occurrences), and not generally regarded as a personal right (but rather, a privilege)?  I know this is a stretch, but this <em>could</em> be an explanation for the ""impersonal"" way in which AE uses the word — unless my history is all wrong here?

</blockquote>



<p>I grew up in a non-English speaking country. During my elementary and middle school years, I self-studied the grammar of English via various books written by the most famous experts in my country, although these were beyond what were required by my curriculum. I am not saying my English is good enough now, but the study from the old days still helps me a lot for my life in U.S. later.</p>

<p>After coming to U.S., I have often got my mind boggled by various usages of English either in talks or in prints, which seem to be inconsistent with what I have learned before. In my guess, the reasons can be a combination of any of the following: </p>

<ol>
<li>what I have learned is probably
based on British English;</li>
<li>the usage by American is not always
rigorous, which sometimes put me
into the dilemma of which to follow;</li>
<li>I might need some excellent English
grammar books whose authors are
trustworthy experts who are also
native English speaker.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, my question is, as for my last point, what are your recommendations for English grammar books? I would like to read comprehensive and nice-organized books from being concise, to being detailed. I think books for middle and elementary schools are perhaps not what I am looking for.</p>

<p>Thanks and regards!</p>

<p>I've got an impression that there is (or was) a rule in English: </p>

<p>If you have a rarely used word with two vowel letters in a row, corresponding to two vowel sounds in a row (as opposed to a diphthong or single vowel sound marked by two letters), you have to mark a second vowel with a trema.</p>

<p>For example: <em>coöperation</em>.</p>

<p>As rarely used word gets more popular and recognizable, trema is dropped from the spelling. In contemporary English <em>cooperation</em> is spelled without it.</p>

<p>In Germany, our English teachers always taught us that contractions like ""didn't"", ""he's"", ""won't"" and so on are perfectly valid to use also in written English. The only difference to writing the long version, consisting of two words, was that it would only count as one word.</p>

<p>However, in Singapore, where I currently am for an exchange year, if you use these contractions in a test, they will be marked as a mistake. The teacher says it is not allowed to use them in written English.</p>

<p>This question is a little hard to summarize in the title.</p>

<p>I sometimes like to use parentheses to add additional (but nonessential) details to a sentence - like I did just there. My criteria for such use is usually that the sentence could be read with the text in the parentheses, or excluding the text, and each would be an equally valid and grammatically correct statement.</p>

<p>So I am curious: in a case where the parenthesis is preceded by the word 'a', and the word in parenthesis begins with a vowel (or unsounded h) that would require it to be changed to 'an', what is the correct statement?</p>

<li>In addition to these three journal articles containing background information, I have included <strong>an (anecdotal) reference</strong> describing this proposed cure.</li>
</ol>

<p>I feel as though if I use the word 'an' it draws too much attention to the word anectodal, and I might as well just remove the parentheses. I'm just trying to slip the word in there to cover my ass if someone says ""That's not a valid reference - it's just an anectote."" If you are curious about the context: the anecdotal reference is included because it describes the process in greater detail than is captured by my summary.</p>

However, I have come accross a problem I feel is of much concern and is in essence a problem with the (English) language, in part that is, not as a whole.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am writing a song about a person who is climbing a mountain, but they are doing so both physically, and then metaphorically. This is a song that is supposed to represent human weakness and strength, and so naturally that includes both men and women.</p>

<p>The lyrics go something like this:</p>

<p>1.2-2 Oh...</p>

<p>The lyrics presented are not meant to be grammatically correct, to me they just need to represent the words to fit the song. Also, the numbers are just units of time, but that doesn't matter here. </p>

Now, whilst this is common practise, I do not think it is good practice, so I was wondering if there may be another, ideally single syllable word, that one could use to describe both males and females. </p>

<p>Take ""StackExchange"" and its acronym, SE, as an example:  <em>I read a StackExchange thread the other day about the history of bananas!</em></p>

<p>If you were to use the ""SE"" acronym instead of ""StackExchange,"" you would probably write: *I read <strong><em>an</em></strong> SE thread the other day about the history of bananas!*  The way in which this differs from my situation is that it's very reasonable to assume that when you write ""SE,"" that you are perfectly fine with the two letters ""ess"" and ""eee"" standing in for ""Stack Exchange,"" much like FCC, SEC, NASDAQ, NATO, etc. completely stand in and are even far more well-known than their longer, official names.</p>

<p>Let's say, however, that you're talking about ""solar-powered asynchronous communication transmission,"" which you abbreviate with ""SPACT"" because you don't want to keep retyping ""solar-powered asynchronous communication transmission,"" not only because you want to be lazy but also because reading those words more than one time every sentence can get in the way of comprehension.  Now, if you were to pronounce this ""ess-pee...etc."" then, of course, you'd say ""<strong><em>an</em></strong> SPACT device,"" but let's say you don't want ""SPACT"" to be referred to, phonetically, by its letters (or even ""SPACT"") and are simply using it as an abbreviation?

<p>Studying phrasal verbs I found <strong><em>break in</em></strong> meaning as <strong><em>interruption</em></strong>. My teacher suggested that it can be also used in news as <strong><em>breaking news</em></strong>, but usually the midia use the gerund form. Actually, both sounds very similar in speech so I was wondering if <strong><em>breaking</em></strong> is an evolution of <strong><em>break in</em></strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>
  <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/48/gender-neutral-pronoun"">Gender neutral pronoun</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Very often, I find myself writing about <em>a user</em>, an anonymous person whose gender I don't know.</p>

<p>Right after mentioning this abstract user, I need to make a reference to the said person, and I often end up using <em>he/she</em>, as a shorter version of <em>he or she</em>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the user may get confused by
  the fact that green button turns red
  when he/she presses the blue button.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I need to make another reference in another sentence right after that, and I find it heavy to write <em>he/she</em> again... So I write <em>he</em>.</p>

<p>I am confused by this because in French, every single noun has a gender. We don't have any neuter. <em>Utilisateur</em>, which means user in French, is masculine. Whereas <em>personne</em> is feminine.</p>

<p>So I don't have this problem in French. If I talk about <em>a user</em> then I can say <em>he</em>. If I talk about <em>a person</em>, I say <em>she</em>. </p>

<p>But how to deal properly and elegantly with this situation in English?</p>

<p>Is it acceptable to say <em>he</em>, as when one says <em>man</em> while talking about both men and women in general? </p>

  <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9986/style-question-use-of-we-vs-i-vs-passive-voice-in-a-dissertation"">Style Question: Use of “we” vs. “I” vs. passive voice in a dissertation</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the first person voice is used in scientific writing it is mostly used in the first person plural, as scientific papers almost always have more than one co-author, such as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We propose a new method to study cell differentiation in nematodes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often the ""we"" also includes the reader</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We may see in Figure 4.2 that...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I am writing a thesis which means I am the only author and I even have to testify in writing that the work is my own and I did not receive any help other than from the indicated sources. Therefore it seems I should use ""I"", but this seems to be very unusual in scientific writing and even discouraged as one may sound pretentious or self-absorbed. However, the alternative is to use the passive voice, which seems to be even more discouraged as it produces hard to read writing and indeed an entire thesis in the passive voice may be indigestible for any reader.</p>

<p>So far, I used the second form of ""we"" extensively that includes me and the reader. This form is often natural when describing mathematical derivations as the truth is objective and it suggests that I am taking the reader by the hand and walking her through the process. Still, I'm trying not do overdo this form. </p>

<p>However, eventually I will need to refer to methods that <em>I</em> propose and choices that <em>I</em> have made. Should I just follow scientific convention and use ""we"" although it is factually inaccurate or indeed write in the scorned-upon ""I""?</p>

151739	Resources on writing grammatically and clearly	"<p>The first part of this question is about how I should ask this question.  I am a bit confused about all the terms used to describe books written about English.  For example, ""usage"", ""style"", ""reference"", ""reference grammars"", etc.  So I don't know what the proper term is for the type of book I want to ask about.</p>

<p>So I've seen the thread on English reference grammars (english.stackexchange.com/questions/183/what-are-some-of-the-better-english-reference-grammars), and my question is similar.  That thread asks about texts that describe English grammar, but I'm wondering about more practical books.</p>

<p>For example, when I'm writing, I often come up with a myriad of questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>When should one use ""that"" vs. ""which""?</li>
<li>How do you deal with multiple descriptive clause modifiers, or whatever they're called, that both end with nouns, leading to ambiguity.  For example: ""I looked at the bucket at the bottom of the barrel that contained my money.""  Let's say that the bucket is the object that contains the money, not the barrel.  Well if you say ""the bucket that contained my money at the bottom of the barrel"" that could still be ambiguous, because now maybe ""at the bottom of the barrel"" could refer to the money.  This is a bad example, but you get the gist of it; how do you deal with these double-bind ambiguities?</li>
<li>Is it grammatical to do a comma then a gerund phrase like I just did in that last bullet point?  For example: ""This drug is fatal, causing death within seconds."" Is that grammatical?</li>
<li>When should one put hyphens between nouns?</li>
<li>Is it grammatical to use nouns as adjectives?  E.g. ""double-bind ambiguities"".  There's probably a better way to say that, right?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on and so on.  Now, one could ask/search for every single question that pops into your head on this stack exchange, but that seems infeasible for a large volume.  So there must be some reference book that would give one the background to know the answer to these types of questions.  After all, the people on this stack exchange had to learn it somewhere, right?</p>

<p>I understand the difference between ""into"" and ""in to"".  The first involves the movement towards the inside of a place.  The latter, is a combination of an adverb and preposition.

<p>The dictionary seems to think that they are the same. Here are their definitions:</p>

<blockquote>

  <strong>Elvish</strong>: Just provides a link to ""elfish""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that ""elvish"" can also refer to the language of the elves, but what I'm asking, is there a difference between ""elfish"" and ""elvish"" in this way:</p>

<p>""Elfish"" is like an elf, as in ""elfish looking girl"". But ""elvish"" means that something is of an elf, that is, it comes from an elf, or is an elf, i.e. ""Elvish man"" meaning a man whose race is that of an elf. Is there such a difference in meaning?</p>

<p>If that's not clear enough, something like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a: That's an elfish man. Yes the one in the jacket. Small and sprightly and everything.<br>
  b: He's actually elvish. His father was an elf.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a philosophy describing a way of thinking and acting. Acting on this philosophy requires work: your mind will slip out of engaging it in if you don't keep up a practice of keeping to it. Over time, you also get better at understanding this philosophy and at keeping to it.</p>

<p>I'm inclined to say one ""hones to"" the philosophy. I realize this is a slight abuse of the meaning of ""hone"" and conflates it with ""home in"". I also have <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/32684/which-is-correct-home-in-or-hone-in"">no interest here in whether to say ""home in"" or ""hone in"" in the usual context</a>, because I want to say something different from what is meant by ""home in"".</p>

<p>I'm trying to express these ideas simultaneously with ""hone to"" or ""hone toward"":</p>

<ul>
<li>you get close to acting based on the philosophy (you are ""homing in"" on what it describes)</li>
<li>you need to ""hone your skill"" at following the philosophy</li>
<li>you are trying to keep close to what the philosophy describes rather than drifting</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there some already existing word or expression which captures this idea? I have thus far not found anything.</p>

<p>Alternatives I considered include ""follow"", which I dislike because it sounds passive, and ""track to"", using the meaning of track here as it is used in sailing terminology (c.f. ""jibe""). I'd also prefer to stick with Germanic words because I like how they sound in this context, but I'm open to alternatives.</p>

37411	"Where did the names of English letters come from, and why are they all monosyllabic (except for ""w"")?"	"<p>I don't know too many languages, but the ones I know have more elaborate names for their letters than the monosyllabicity of names for English letters. (E.g. - I'll pick on Greek here - <em>ay</em> instead of <em>alpha</em>, <em>bee</em> for <em>beta</em>, etc.)  How did these short names evolve, and when?</p>

<p>Further, why do nine of the letter-names (B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z) end with ""ee"" (as in ""bee""), while six others (F, L, M, N, S, X) begin with ""eh"" (as in ""ef"")?  And why do (H, K, Q, R, W, sometimes Z) have less orthodox names?  (Is ""ar"" for ""R"" a corruption of ""ehr"", perhaps?) ""J"" needs to be different, so as not to be confused with ""G"".  The remaining ones (vowels, incidentally: A, I, O, U, Y) I understand as not possible to fit into any regular pattern.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer is simply that letter-names, like the language, are not logically created; rather evolved erratically.  But I want to make sure.  Does anyone have any answers?</p>

<p>But unfortunately the example given is able to be easily phrased a different way and so respondents have been able to get away with avoiding the direct question.</p>

<p>Let's face it, we come across the need to get across the concept of mutual possession all the time and we don't always want to have to resort to the more tortured ""Z of X and Y"" as with the French language.</p>

<p>NB: In some cases, people get around this problem by dropping the apostrophes altogether and ""adjectivising"" the owners, especially if the owners are actually plural entities themselves. Eg. The ""Mazda and Mitsubishi combined outputs"" instead of the ""Mazda's and Mitsubishi's combined outputs"". Let's not let this muddy the waters though.</p>

"<p>Despite being a native speaker of American English, I cannot find a construction that sounds natural when trying to form a possessive from coordinated subjects including a first person pronoun, like ""He and I"" or ""My brother and I."" If it's ""You and I,"" I can just use ""our."" But what is the proper way to form a possessive in these other instances?</p>

<p>What does the noun ""lucker"" mean? Yes, it's not in the Webster, but Google does give search results for such key phrases as ""I am a lucker"" or ""He is a lucker"" (and those are not misspellings like ""luckier"" or ""lurker""). So people DO you use that word. I myself heard it a number of times. And if they use it, it should have some meaning. So, here is my question: what does the noun ""lucker"" mean?</p>

<p>I graduated with an English Major from Radford University back in 1991, but over the years I've done a lot of technical writing as a web developer, and it does not make sense to me to put punctuation inside quoted terms. For instance...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you find the item marked 'Lever A', please move it near 'Lever B'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...rather than...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you find the item marked 'Lever A,' please move it near 'Lever B.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason is because I'm not quoting what someone said.</p>

<p>Of course, when we use double quotes or single quotes for these terms, that's just a problem with typography where we might not have italics available to us. The best way to compose this, then, would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you find the item marked <em>Lever A</em>, please move it near <em>Lever B</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, sometimes when composing an email or other form of communication where italics may not necessarily be available to us, it appears that double quotes or single quotes are used and therefore we get stuck in this problem.</p>

<p>Last month I decided to change my residence and shift to another town. After some days, due to some reasons, I cancelled my program and decided to stay at my current place. At that time I sent a message to my friends, ""I've <strong>decided not to</strong> leave A.I. Town"". </p>

<p>After sending the message, a question flashed in my mind that have I used ""to"" at the correct place. Shouldn't it be ""I've <strong>decided to not</strong> leave A.I. Town""?</p>

<p>I am actually confused that should I separate the preposition ""to"" and the verb ""decided"" in the prepositional phrase ""decided to"" by using ""not"" in between them?</p>

<p>Reading the <a href=""http://bugs.python.org/msg65513"" rel=""nofollow"">text</a> I came across the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

  expression only to find that one recompiles it and has to do the same
  work all over again when it may have been done 3 expressions ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is regarding the part of the phrase highlighted in bold.</p>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<p>My guess is that it's inversion (inverted phrase ""[though] it is all rare"") But I don't understand why there is <em>be</em>, not <em>is</em> (all is it rare). And it looks quite strange to me.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Aedia commented that it's probably a misspelling of <em>albeit</em>.</p>

<p>I opened an <a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=albeit"" rel=""nofollow"">etymology dictionary</a> and found that <em>albeit</em> is a contraction of <em>al be it</em>, ""al(though) it be (that)"".</p>

<p>So, I still can't understand, why there is <em>be</em> (in the original phrase, from which <em>albeit</em> is derived from), not <em>is</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>After reading the linked questions, I still can't grasp what connotation subjunctive mood carries in comparison with indicative mood in this particular example.</p>

<p>In the linked questions <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/17428/why-is-albeit-pronounced-the-way-it-is/17430#17430"">one of the answer</a> was that <em>all <strong>be</strong> it</em> = <em>although it <strong>is</strong> that</em></p>

<p>But in the comments to this question there was a remark that <strong>be</strong> and <strong>is</strong> express different moods.</p>

<p>To express my question clear, I'll lay it out in the following way:</p>

<p>What is the difference with these structures?</p>

<ul>
<li>The danger, although it be rare,... </li>
<li>The danger, although it is rare,...</li>

170723	Non-pejorative term for behaviour that discriminates against people based on their birth place	"<p>A big theme of the UK May 2014 MEP elections is immigration - there is a great deal of political rhetoric about it that I would describe as <em>racist</em> or <em>xenophobic</em>, but I don't think either term is entirely suitable given how they are used now in UK media.</p>

<p>In addition these terms (<em>racist</em> especially) are generally considered to be pejorative, so as soon as you use them people get defensive and miss the point. The debate becomes about the ethnic mix of their social circle or supporters, both of which are irrelevant.</p>

<p>This rhetoric is characterised by the location of people's country of origin rather than their race.</p>

<p>An example statement would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I'm not racist, but only British people should be able to apply for British jobs.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think these statements are <em>racist</em> exactly, as a person could be any race and be British, or not be British and still be of an Anglo-Saxon white origin. </p>

<p>However they do represent a kind of discrimination: they state that if the most skilled person for a job is not from the UK they should be rejected in favour of a less skilled local. They state that someone who isn't British should not get the same rights and privileges as someone who is. </p>

<p>The rhetoric that goes with these statements tends to also make value statements about the immigrants in question, often describing their intentions as parasitic or that these immigrants would be seeking to change British culture or legislation.</p>

<p>Is there a term for that kind of discrimination or prejudice?</p>

<p>Please note that I'm not trying to encourage any kind of political debate on here - I'm just looking for a way to describe this kind of political argument as discriminatory without referring to race.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>This question has been flagged incorrectly as a duplicate. I know that the legal definition of <em>racism</em> includes discrimination based on nationality. However, in the UK political sphere at least, the common interpretation of of racism is limited to racial groups. The political parties that use this rhetoric do not consider it to be racist, and the pejorative nature of the term means that using it just ends any chance of building an argument that they might actually listen to.  </p>

<p>I understand that <em>racist</em> is technically correct, I'm asking for constructive alternatives.</p>

<p>The answers to that question do not help with this issue.</p>

<h2>Update 2</h2>

<p><em>Xenophobic</em> is a good answer, but not really what I'm looking for as it implies the motivation for the behaviour, rather than describing the behaviour itself.</p>

<p>For instance a typical response might be:</p>

<blockquote>

<h2>Update 3</h2>

<p>This question has been flagged as a duplicate of another question, but these are different questions with different answers. The supposed duplicate asks: <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159908"">If a person holds prejudice against people because of their nationality, would that be considered racist?</a> - I'm specifically not asking about prejudice; I'm asking about <em>discrimination</em>. </p>

<p>I can state that a political party's policies or proposals are inherently discriminatory if the action treats one group differently from another. I'm not making a judgement about them if I do so, I'm just stating a deduction.</p>

<p>I can't state for certain that this discrimination is due to their prejudice - they may or may not have prejudiced opinions, but accusing them of prejudice causes offence and any constructive discussion ends there.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to describe behaviour that discriminates without making guesses as to the motivation or any prejudice behind it?</p>

<ul>
<li><em>meters</em> measures <em>distances</em> or <em>lengthes</em>,</li>
<li><em>volt</em> measures <em>tension</em> or voltage, ,</li>
<li><em>kelvin</em> measures <em>temperature</em>,</li>
<li><em>second</em> measures <em>time</em>,</li>
<li><em>ampere</em> measures <em>electric current</em>,</li>
<li><em>kilogram</em> measures <em>mass</em>,</li>
</ul>

<p>But what measures the ""Byte"" unit ? I'm looking for a word that would take the same place than <em>mass</em> takes for <em>kilogram</em>, but for <em>Byte</em> (or <em>bit</em>, as 8 <em>bit</em> makes a <em>Byte</em>.). There's only very unspecific terms that springs to my mind (<em>size</em>, <em>capacity</em>, ...):</p>

<ul>
<li>My file is 3.2 KB in <code><fill the blank></code> ?</li>
<li>My hard drive has a <code><fill the blank></code> of 2TB.</li>
<li>Byte measures <code><fill the blank></code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Could it be <em>information</em> ? But the word alone doesn't seem to refer to something that can be measured. And you don't use it as naturally. For example, in a technical specification you could see:</p>

<ul>
<li>mass: 3kg</li>
<li>temperature: 2°</li>
<li>voltage: 3V</li>
<li><code><fill the blank></code>: 3TB</li>
</ul>

<p>But what would you use here in front of ""3TB"" for instance ? It seems we must use 2 words, for example:  ""information size"". But even this doesn't seem so natural.</p>

<p>Have you any word suggestions that I've might missed, references on this topic, if not, do you know other units that don't have a proper word to name what they measures ?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm a software developer and I know relatively well what a Byte measures. I'm looking for a specific English word that could be used as naturally as you would use the word ""mass"" to qualify what you measure when you say ""3 kilograms"".</p>

<p>However, sometimes ""less"" is used with countable nouns (famously the ""X items or <em>less</em>"" register in supermarkets). When can countable nouns be used with ""less""? Consider these examples: </p>

<ul>
<li>I'll only need five minutes or <em>less</em> to mow the lawn.</li>
<li>A lawnmower may only go 5 mph or <em>less</em>.</li>
<li>You may only use my lawnmower if you weigh 75 kg or <em>less</em>.</li>

<p>I was wondering if you could help me out with a matter that is bugging me.</p>

<p>Do you think it is wrong to refer to 18:00hs as ""eighteen hours"" while reading a time-table in a 24-hour clock country?</p>

<p>I mean, is it really necessary to convert the 24-hour clock times to 12-hour clock in order to speak proper English?</p>

<p>I had an argument yesterday regarding this issue, because someone was trying to correct me, as he was expecting to hear 6 PM instead of the way I was reading it (eighteen hours).</p>

<p>Doesn't it eventually depend on your situational context?</p>

<p>It's not the same case for a 24-hour clock European citizen traveling to England than the other way round. If going to England, I should try to adapt to the local system, since I know they are 12-hour based and they may not understand me if I start talking in 24-hour clock. </p>

<p>But if an English person goes to a country with a different time setting (24-hour clock based), the situation is different. Because times will be written in 24-hour clock formats, time-tables will be printed in 24-hour clock formats, etc. He will need that skill in order to fit in. He should be able to understand that 18hs (or eighteen hours) refers to 6 PM, and in that context, not even an English native speaker, IMO, should be in position to tell anyone that ""eighteen hours"" is wrong.</p>

<p>Since mine is a 24-hour clock based country, would you consider it wrong, then, for someone to read a time-table in this fashion?</p>

<p>Here is an interesting article on how many Europeans, for example, that live in a 24h-hour clock country (like mine), refer verbally to their 24-hour based times when expressing themselves in English.</p>

<p>In written form they just write the time in their local 24-hour form (of course), but when speaking, however, they might use either the 24-hour-clock number, or a 12-hour-clock number followed by the phrase (in local lingo) ""in the afternoon"" (we also use that form but informally) —so at 3pm, they may say ""it's fifteen o'clock"" (or, more usually, just ""it's fifteen"") or they might say ""it's three in the afternoon.""</p>

<p>I am assuming it does have a reason to say <strong>she</strong>, otherwise the author would've said <em>she/he</em> (<strong><em>she/he</strong> feels hasn't received enough attention</em>) and <em>himself/herself</em> (<em>The product owner <strong>herself/himself</em></strong>) </p>

<p>Let me just stress out one point case someone gets jumpy:- I am <strong>not</strong> being sexist - I don't care if the author says <em>he</em> or <em>she</em> or <em>the person</em> or <em>the being</em>. All I am trying to do is understand if there is a special reason as to why he treated those roles as female roles. I may also add that in my native language every noun has a gender, as in French or Portuguese, and therefore treating a noun as a female one in English puzzles me a bit. </p>

<p>""That"" is a very difficult word for me. I keep feeling compelled to add it in just about any sentence in which I talk about an action or state something I believe/think.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think <strong>that</strong> you're wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope <strong>that</strong> the company will get back to what they do best and come up with a proper keyboard next time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And don’t tell me <strong>that</strong> the price is justified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I doubt <strong>that</strong> they have any programmers working on this.</p>

<p>All these constructions make sense without the ""that"", don't they? So then why do I feel this compulsion to add it?</p>

<p>I have often heard members of the British public pronounce the name of the supermarket chain Tesco as ""Tesco's"" or ""Tescos"".</p>

<p>Thinking that it was formerly called ""Tesco's"", as many old British companies are, I looked up its history and learnt that it is a concatenation of the initials of its early tea supplier's name (T. E. Stockwell) and the first two letters of the founder's surname (Cohen), and was never called ""Tesco's"".</p>

<p>Is it because of confusion with other supermarkets such as Sainsbury's and Morrisons? If so, why have I not heard ""Asda's"", ""Co-op's"" or ""SPAR's""?</p>

<p>What's that figure of speech in which you use the same word to define its meaning, thereby not really defining it.</p>

<p>Like, ""YAML Ain't Markup Language"", the expanded form of the abbreviation YAML uses itself in its definition and thus doesn't really define the actual thing.</p>

<p>In this case, though, through negation, it restricts the purview of its meaning to a fairly ascertainable concept. But that's just one example.</p>

<p>Like in this definition of the Internet, ""The Internet, a backward formation of inter-network, is a network of networks.""</p>

<p>It's not synecdoche, as I used to think.</p>

<p>For instance a elusive statement like ""God is...well, only God can define God."" exemplifies it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ANCHOR: This is 6.1 on the Richter scale, that means ... one-tenth the power of the one that struck in '89?</p>
  
  <p>HAYS: No, that's the confusion ... It's nearly <b>thirty times mo—weaker</b>. It's <b>one-thirtieth</b> of the Loma Prieta earthquake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) As it happens, this touches on a longstanding peeve (and I am perfectly willing to describe it as such) that I have about the use of positive multipliers to describe the lack of something: <i>twice as small</i>, <i>three times colder</i>. In everyday use, of course, this pattern is readily understood as indicating the reciprocal of the opposite quality: something that's <i>thirty times weaker</i> is actually <i>one-thirtieth as strong</i>. It was interesting to hear Mr. Hays catch himself making the mistake, and then correct himself using more formally precise language—something I think a scientist would be more likely to do than a layperson.</p>

<p>So my question is: <i>Is</i> this really a mistake, or is it actually semantically proper/meaningful to use language indicating a positive magnitude to characterize a concept that is defined specifically as a lack of something else? We don't have a problem using ordinary intensifiers and superlatives in such contexts: a thing can be <i>very small</i> or <i>much weaker</i>. It seems intuitive to me that a multiplier should be treated differently from an intensifier, but I can't actually define why that should be the case. What about the reverse: if <i>twice as small</i> is semantically proper, what about <i>half as small</i> (the obvious ambiguity notwithstanding)? Or are these all more properly thought of as physics or mathematics questions, rather than language questions?</p>

182481	How to order food that is hot (temperature) but not hot (amount of capsaicin)?	"<p>Some food contains capsaicin which is a substance that comes from chili or pepper and gives food its burning taste. In english you call this type of taste ""hot"". In German (my native language) we say ""scharf"" which literally is ""sharp"" in english (sharp like a knife).</p>

<p>I am suffering form a capsaicin intolerance. To me even low amounts of chili or pepper make my mouth feel like burning in hellfire. Sweat flows out of every pore of my skin even when I taste food that contains very small amounts of this substance that others won't notice. </p>

<p>So in a restaurant I want to order food that contains no capsaicin. In German I can say ""Bitte nicht scharf!"" But in english this is ""Please not hot!""</p>

<p>Last year I spent 2 month in London and very often I got food that was cold and tasted like burning fire (they gave me the normal spiced food but didn't heat it). To make clear what I want I can say in German ""Bitte nicht scharf, aber heiß!"". How do you say that in english? ""Please not hot, but hot!""?</p>

<h2>EDIT 1:</h2>

<p>This question is different form <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/55052/how-to-say-that-food-is-hot-temperature-without-the-listener-thinking-that-i-m"">How to say that food is hot (temperature) without the listener thinking that I mean ""spicy""?</a> because the answers to the other Question doesn't help me to order food that contains no capsaicin.</p>

<p>The other question hat its focus on the aspect of temperature in the word ""hot"". This is not my focus. My focus is the amount of capsaicin in the food that is expressed by talking about ""hot food"", and how to avoid getting served such food.</p>

<h2>EDIT 2:</h2>

<p>Obviously I didn't make it clear enough: I love spicy food. I love mustard, horseradish, onions, garlic, wasabi, ginger and so on. I hate food that tastes boring and bland. And I hate cold food that usually is served warm. I just want no capsaicin in my food. Capsaicin is in Chili, Cayenne pepper, Piri piri, Tabasco pepper, Jalapeño and many other fruits from plants of the genus ""Capsicum"". Also Hungarian paprica (used for Goulash) and Peperoncini (you often find them on pizzas) contain capsaicin, not really much, but too much for me.</p>

<p>There is no capsaicin in horseradish, wasabi, onions, garlic, and most other spices. I have no problem with those spices. I like to eat food that is spiced with them.</p>

  Person B: No</p>

<p>Recently I've noticed an increasing use of the phrase <strong>to hate <em>on</em></strong> [someone].</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the addition of <strong><em>on</em></strong> implies a jealousy or dislike for another person's talent or status. It doesn't appear that <strong><em>to hate</em></strong> and <strong><em>to hate on</em></strong> are directly interchangeable; one wouldn't say <em>""I really hate on the taste of fish""</em> for example.</p>

<p>English is not my native language, but I use it on a daily basis. I started reading English literature about two years ago. Mostly I read science fiction and fantasy, but also read other books. Once in a while (several times per chapter) I come across words I need to check in a dictionary. That's all good, I keep learning more. But what I'm concerned with is that I bought a dictionary of 55000 English words, and by my experience I encounter words about once per chapter that are not in this dictionary. And that doesn't count slang or words with mixed endings. Just the words in their basic forms as nouns or adjectives or verbs and so forth.</p>

""Well, I'd argue one of the few things the play does say about love (and sexual love, one of its key focusses) is that it is changable: it depends on the moment - and, like ""dreams"" as a whole, its pleasure doesn't last forever.</p>

184870	Confusion over the general rules governing the use of the hyphen in English	"<p>I often get confused by the rules for using hyphens. According to <a href=""http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/hyphen"" rel=""nofollow"">this entry</a> from the Oxford Dictionaries web site, I must always use a hyphen in these cases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Hyphens are used in many compound words to show that the component words have a combined meaning. </li>
  <li>Hyphens can be used to join a prefix to another word, especially if the prefix ends in a vowel and the other word also begins with one (e.g. <em>pre-eminent</em> or <em>co-own</em>).</li>
  <li>Hyphens can also be used to divide words that are not usually hyphenated.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, with these three rules in mind, I suppose I should write <em>living-room</em>: after all, these two words have a combined meaning. To support this argument, I may say we write <em>bedroom</em> — one word only — which means we’ve combined <em>bed</em> and <em>room</em> to refer to one thing, the bedroom. So <em>living room</em> should either be hyphenated or written together as only one single word. </p>

<p>Equally, <em>food handling department</em> should be written as <em>food-handling department</em> even though as with <em>living-room</em>, I have never actually seen it written with a hyphen. </p>

<p>I am a bit confused. Isn’t hyphenating these words arguably a grammatical error,  or does hyphen usage vary from one country to another?  (I mean, for example, that perhaps in England they write <em>living room</em>, in Australia <em>livingroom</em>, and in Canada  perhaps <em>living-room</em>.)</p>

<hr>

<p>As tchrist pointed out in the comment section, hyphen usage has nothing to do with grammar. It's only a ortographic convention. </p>

<p>The reason I'm asking this question is: I once took an IELTS preparing course and there was a question whose answer was <em>food-handling department</em> but I wrote <em>food handling department</em>. My answer was considered to be wrong - according to the entity behind the course, <em>food-handling department</em> was the only acceptable answer.  </p>

<p>I have seen in many places, in many articles on the web as well as in print, the practice of including punctuation inside the quotes, when the punctuation is not related to the quoted content, as follows:</p>

<p>Shouldn't the following be correct, with the comma outside the end quote?</p>

<p>Is it just me or has the word combination ""off of"", and it's big brother ""off of it"", gained a certain prominence recently? People <em>jump off of [something]</em>, they find a business model and <em>make money off of it</em>, you can <em>eat off of it</em> and some people request to <em>keep your hands off of it</em> (whatever <em>if</em> refers to, then).

<p>I found the word, ‘<em>Obama-lite’</em> in the headline of the Time magazine article (March 17) , titled “Santo: “We’re Not Just An Obama-Lite.” The article quotes the following remark of Rick Santorum aired on a Missouri radio: </p>

<p>""If we keep winning and doing well and we keep winning the states were supposed to win and upsetting in states and do either very well..., we're going to win the nomination. I have no doubt about that whatsoever. We're the candidate that's energizing folks. We're the candidate that has the best chance of beating Barack Obama.... <em>We're not just an Obama-lite.""</em></p>

<p>As I am unfamiliar with the usage of suffix, -lite, I checked its meanings in dictionaries at hand;</p>

<p>Readers English Japanese dictionary defines -lite as; 
1. the suffix used for fossils, minerals, explosives, products.
2.a believer of, or in a person.</p>

<p>www.yourdictionary defines it only as stone: used in the names of minerals, rocks, and fossils, e.g. chrysolite, cryolite.</p>

<p>wikitionary.org defines it simply as “used to form names of rocks and minerals

211980	Is it grammatically correct to use his, her, or his/her?	"<p>I've always thought that using the word ""his"" as a gender-nonspecific pronoun has been acceptable; in recent years, however, I've been told off by people when I do this, saying it is now ""politically"" correct you use ""her"" for a gender-nonspecific pronoun. I've always have, since these occurrences, used ""his/her"" (or ""his or her"") instead, though I am now pondering which of these to use, for I am currently writing a paper, and have no idea which pronoun to use; the ""his or her"" seems a little clunky, and I would much rather prefer an alternative.</p>

<p>I know some people who use ""they"", but as that both sounds and is ungrammatical, I'm wondering if there is any other concise and non-awkward alternative.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em></p>

<p><em>Apparently many do consider ""they"" as correct. This surprised me, because I know someone who actually wrote a grammar book, who told me in no uncertain terms that ""they"" could not be used (in fact, I'd asked them - ha! - this question before I posted it here). And a quick look online found legitimate sources advocating both positions. I suppose it's one of those issues, such as whether the previous sentence was incorrect for beginning with a conjunction, where it really just depends who you ask. Regardless, to me personally, ""they"" in the above example sounds clunky at best and incorrect at worst. So I suppose my question can be rephrased as, <strong>'is there any alternative to 'he or she', other than 'they'?</strong>""</em></p>

<p><em>Secondly, to whoever tagged this as ""politically-correct"": acknowledging the existence of genderqueer or transgender people isn't a political issue at all, until those made uncomfortable by people unlike them make it one. Trying to avoid excluding and thus unconsciously discriminating against a group of people in your writing isn't born out of a need to be 'politically correct' - it's born out of basic human decency.</em></p>

<p><em>Finally, yes, in the example above, I could use a comma and avoid the need for a pronoun at all - but the question I'm asking applies to instances where one may not want to do so (i.e. the sentences are long and stringy enough as it is).</em></p>

Is there a reason why these words don't exist in English whereas in a language like Chinese this is well established? I thought it might be because back then there are larger families in China and it is difficult otherwise to identify people specifically, but then in English we do have words like uncle and aunty (without specifying the side of the family they are from), and we do have words like brother-in-law or mother-in-law to identify other types of relationships.</p>

<p>If I can't understand what someone said very well, how to ask him to repeat his words, but in slightly different way?</p>

<p>If I say, <code>I don't understand</code>, he may think that I'm not agree with his opinion.
I'm not sure if <code>Pardon?</code> or <code>Sorry?</code> work in written English. </p>

<p>If what he said looks very simple: there is no uncommon words, then, I am expected to understand, however I can't. So it's more likely that I'm against their opinions if I say I don't understand. Because what he said is so easy. So, I would like him to repeat his sentence in a different way, using different words maybe. How can I ask him to repeat in different way politely?</p>

207453	Ending a sentence with a preposition?	"<p>Recently in an episode of 'House of cards' they bring up the joke</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Two freshmen girls are moving into their dorm room together. One of them's from Georgia, one of them's from Connecticut. The girl from Connecticut's helping her mother put up curtains. Girl from Georgia turns to them and says, ""Hi. Where y'all from?"" Girl from Connecticut says, ""We're from a place where we know not to end a sentence with a preposition."" The girl from Georgia says, ""Oh, beg my pardon. Where y'all from...cunt?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, i suppose the punchline has something to do with the not-preposition, but what i don't get is why the Connecticut girl even considers that a sentence cannot end with a preposition?
Is there any reason for stating that prepositions can't be on the end of a sentence? And if not, what is the punchline of this joke?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I am an ESL teacher in Thailand at a business college. I have been plagued with the distinction between, ""(be) going to "" and ""will"" for the future tense.
In my former life, I worked in IT and Telecommunications. 
My conclusions about any distinction(s) are the following:</p>

<p>1) Any distinction is not really grammatical, but more under the banner of usage 
2) It is possible to communicate effectively in the future tense while using the two forms interchangeably.</p>

<p>There may be circumstances where one form is ""more desirable"" over the other, but both would seem grammatically correct. One book that the administration is forcing me to use at gunpoint, is a piece of feces titled  ""Interchange"" published by Cambridge University Press. They represent the distinction between ""will"" and ""going to"" as  a <em>maybe</em> and <em>certainly</em> with respect to plans. Baffling because I can not find any other references. </p>

<p>Considering the lack of competency in English of the average Thai speaker; myself as a native speaker who is not attentive to the distinctions but on occasion, does manage to effectively communicate and do so  in a somewhat elegant manner — is it worth emphasizing the relative interchangeability of the two forms, rather than the minor distinctions in usage of the two forms. I say minor, because if the distinctions are not made, <em>very</em> effective and accurate communication by a non-native speaker is still able to be accomplished without drawing a distinction. </p>

<p>My concern being that the weight given to this relatively minor footnote in meaning (usage), is deceptive and may confuse rather enlighten anyone other than an expert non-native speaker. </p>

<p>Programmer here. I am confused with the usage of the term ""She/he"" when referring a prementioned and undefined user. Below is a sentence found from MSDN magazine:</p>

<p>""When the user decides to create a new customer, <strong>she</strong> must fill in the data entry form in Figure 2."" </p>

<p>I myself use the term ""She/he"" is this context, since without mentioning both can be regarded as gender discrimination, and placing 'she' before 'he' is respecting the ladies. </p>

<p>So, can I just use 'She' in this context, that will save some typing. </p>

<p>Does this sound OK? I don't like ending with a preposition, but it does get the point across. Any suggestions to replacing the phrase ""being talked to""</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>After reading similar questions on this topic, Edward Tanguay referenced a site, <a href=""http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/prepositions/ending-a-sentence-with-a-preposition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/prepositions/ending-a-sentence-with-a-preposition.html</a>

<p>to one of these:</p>

<p>""a soul can sense when it’s being summoned.""</p>

<p>In my work I am often exposed to sentences written by nonnative speakers of English.
I often come across sentences with a singular noun and a plural verb as in:</p>

<p>No error occurs when the file is loaded.</p>

<p>I know this is not technically wrong, but I am used to the general case being written</p>

<p>No errors occur when the file is loaded.</p>

<p>I suppose one argument could be that if you used the plural noun version, it wouldn't cover the case where there is one error. But to me, using the plural noun emphasizes ""not even one"" and so is the better choice. Are these sentences completely interchangeable? Is one preferred by native speakers over the other?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>For my thesis project, I have decided to always use ""we"" instead of ""I"". What do you think of this decision? To me, it seems more common out there to use ""we"". In addition, using ""I"" sounds somewhat ... egoistic.</p>

<p>However, there are cases where I want to stress that I myself, the author, has to do with something.</p>

<p>For instance. It would seem rather unnatural to say ""It is our opinion that..."", because in many cases when using “we”, it is really both the author and the reader that are doing something together. Do you think it's okay in these cases to say ""It is the opinion of <strong>this author</strong> that…""?</p>

<p>So the question is basically twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is using “we” throughout, to mean interchangeably myself, or myself and the reader both together?</p></li>
<li><p>When I want to stress myself, can I use “this author”?</p></li>

<p>Sometimes, you want to use the names of foreign people in English texts. This presents no problem if the person's name is composed of the 26 letters in the English alphabet. If the name contains another character, e.g., <em>é</em> or <em>ß</em>, a decision has to be made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I stick to the original spelling, or</li>
<li>do I find some sort of transcription into the 26 English alphabet characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is of course useful to make sure that the target audience can still understand the text, which probably means that you would have to go with transcription for everything that's originally Cyrillic or Chinese.</p>

<p>In a scientific article, however, <em>Schrödinger</em> with the umlaut is widely used (instead of the transcription <em>Schroedinger</em>). <em>Gauß</em> however is typically spelled as <em>Gauss</em> in English literature, although I would attribute this phenomenon rather to the lack of the key <em>ß</em> on the English typewriter.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>What is the origin of the word <em>copper</em> for referring to a police officer? There is no shortage of explanations available on the Web, and as near as I can tell they fall into three categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is a variation of the Latin <em>capere</em>, meaning, to grab or apprehend — a meaning preserved in expressions like “<em>cop</em> a feel” — that came into use in Britain in the 1700s.</li>
<li>Early English police forces had very large copper helmets (or, in some versions, buttons).</li>
<li>The badges worn by early New York police officers were made of copper.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, some sources have the word arising from “the color of the early police or sheriff cars in the western states”, and even from an acronym for “Constable On Patrol”.</p>

<p>What I can’t find is an authoritative reference on the matter. The OED entry seems to support (1) as an <em>application</em> of the word, at least for <em>cop</em>, but is ambiguous about its origin and says only that “other conjectures have been offered” for <em>copper</em>.</p>

<p>I pronounce ""the"" as ""the"" (with e sounding like the letter sound) in the following example sentences:</p>

<p>However, I can't help but feel like ""asian"", even if it is a step forward socially, is a small step backward in specificity.

<p>I've seen the verb ""help"" be used transitively and intransitively - in the latter case, followed by the preposition ""to"" - in various sentences.  For example, these should have identical meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'll help you do it. / I'll help you to do it.<br>
  Jim helps run the shop. / Jim helps to run the shop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should it be used intransitively in this way, though?  If we have a transitive version, doesn't it make sense to use that instead if we're using this verb with an infinitive?  It also seems to me that using ""help"" intransitively in this way can lead to ambiguity; for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It helps to buy holidays.</p>

<p>Is it allowed to use <em>split infinitives</em> in formal English? I look into Wikipedia but it is too objective and it doesn't directly say that I can use it formally. Is split infinitives grammatical?</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive"" rel=""nofollow"">from Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A split infinitive is an English-language grammatical construction in which a word or phrase, usually an adverb or adverbial phrase, comes between the marker to and the bare infinitive (uninflected) form of a verb.</p>
  
  <p>In some cases, moving the adverbial creates an ungrammatical sentence or changes the meaning. R.L. Trask uses this example:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>She decided <strong>to gradually get</strong> rid of the teddy bears she had collected. <br/>""Gradually"" splits the infinitive ""to get"". However, if the adverb were moved, where could it go?</p></li>
  <li><p>She decided <strong>gradually to get</strong> rid of the teddy bears she had collected. <br/>This might imply that the decision was gradual.</p></li>
  <li><p>She decided <strong>to get</strong> rid of the teddy bears she had collected <strong>gradually</strong>. <br/>This implies that the collecting process was gradual.</p></li>
  <li><p>She decided <strong>to get gradually</strong> rid of the teddy bears she had collected. <br/>This sounds awkward, as it splits the phrase ""get rid of"".</p></li>
  <li><p>She decided <strong>to get</strong> rid <strong>gradually</strong> of the teddy bears she had collected. <br/>This is almost as unwieldy as its immediate predecessor.</p></li>

With those two, I reluctantly surrounded my mini-edit in <code>( )</code> (parenthesis).  This is <em>fine, and all...</em> but as the change was <em>mid-quote</em>, and <em>mid-paragraph</em>, there was no obvious way to clarify that this parenthetical portion was NOT as the credited author had intended - but was instead MY little handiwork.</p>

225672	Demonstrative Pronouns: This/That – Advanced Usage	"<p>When you learn about demonstrative pronouns, it seems like a really simple concept. This/these for nearby (physically, or with regards to time), that/those for distant things. Anywhere you go, online language sites, or Youtube, this is where the story ends mostly. But it seems to miss out on the trickier usage of demonstrative pronouns. I can't figure this out:</p>

<p><strong>Here's a sentence:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Next week may change the rest of your life. And I don't say <strong>that/this</strong> lightly.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would you pick? <strong>This</strong>, or <strong>that</strong>?</p>

<p>I picked ""this"", and it was incorrect, apparently. ""That"" seems to be correct, as in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>And I don't say <strong>that</strong> lightly.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's the rule here, are we still talking demonstrative pronoun, near/distant?</p>

<p><strong>Same as in this:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Check out <strong>this/that</strong> Youtube video: (LINK). What do you think of <strong>this/that</strong>?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The near/distant trick, either in time of physical distance, doesn't really help. Suggestions?</p>

<p>Now, <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/4325/using-that-and-this-interchangeably"">this answer</a> offers some guidance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a concept or idea introduced a few sentences before, I think the

"<p>This is one topic that I thought that I have already known well, but sometimes when I am writing a text or something like this it always come up the doubt of what should I use in the sentence to indicate possession.

</blockquote>



<p>I have a question about the use of the prefix 're', that means 'do it again' in my context. Let me explain: in mathematics we use the concept of 'parameterized' objects, that is, objects obtained while some parameter varies (think of the parameter as the time and the object as a point moving on a plane).</p>

<p>Well, if we describe the movement using the parameter we say that <strong>we are parameterizing</strong> or <strong>the object is parameterized</strong>. So, if we change the parameter by another one (for example, change the speed of the clock) we say that <strong>we are reparameterizing</strong>  the object.</p>

<p>This is my question: Which is better: <strong>reparameterized</strong> or <strong>re-parameterized</strong>? I've just found <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7731/adding-a-prefix-re-to-a-word-with-or-without-a-hyphen"">this discussion</a> but I remain uncertain.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>My question is about a usage error involving contrary-to-fact conditionals. Instead of something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I knew French, I would go to Paris.</li>
<li>If I had known French, I would have gone to Paris.</li>
</ul>

<p>People sometimes say/write something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>*If I would know French, I would go to Paris.</li>
<li>*If I would have known French, I would have gone to Paris.</li>
</ul>

<p>My sense is that the second kind of error is more common than the first. Ten years ago, the error was committed by ESL students only, or at least that's how it seemed to me. But now I frequently encounter it in the language of native English speakers. Here are some examples of the error, taken from Google:</p>

<ul>
<li>*""If I would set up the punishment you describe, I would at least grease or oil the hemp.""</li>
<li>*""If they would have seen it they would have known it was not.""</li>
<li>*""If I would have I would never have experienced the happiness that I have now.""</li>
<li>*""I have learned a hard lesson but still continue to torture myself, mostly with the thought that if I would have pushed harder and more sincerely to be there for her, she probably would have had the baby and we'd be together.""</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this error and written about it (e.g. whether the error has become more common in recent years). I'd especially like to see discussion by real linguists (e.g. Language Log or Languagehat). At least I'd like to find some searchable phrase referring to the error (e.g., ""dangling modifier"").</p>

83143	What's wrong with these sentences?	"<p>My workplace has presented me with the opportunity this month to attend a ""grammar"" webinar that is suppose to help me enhance my grammar skills. I thought they were good already...</p>

<p>I don't have time to attend so will probably miss it, but I feel I should attend because of what was in the email for registration we received.</p>

<p>It gives a list of sentences and asks what's wrong with them, and that if they look correct <em>you</em> should attend!</p>

<p>Could someone explain what is fundamentally wrong with the following sentences?</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>The firm is proud to have served our clients for fifty years.</li>
  <li>Martin and Deborah's reports were both submitted on time.</li>
  <li>If you don't feel well, go and lay down.</li>
  <li>This is a very unique situation.</li>
  <li>I felt badly when my friend lost her job.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>They look fine to me and that worries me.
The only reason I can think of to attempt corrections is because the email suggests that they are wrong!<br></p>

<p><strong>My corrections:</strong></p>

<p>For example, in the <em>first</em> sentence are they using ""served"" in the wrong tense so they're saying they don't serve clients anymore?</p>

<p>In the <em>second</em> sentence is the apostrophe 's' suggesting that Deborah owns both the reports like a possessive (<em>I think that's what it's called</em>)?</p>

<p>I've always followed a rule (<em>I know...</em>) that if I could switch the sentence parts where the comma is and it sounds normal then the comma is OK like in the <em>third</em> sentence. ""Go lay down if you don't feel well"" sounds normal to me.</p>

<p>I always don't understand which one to use, <strong>a</strong> or <strong>the</strong> or nothing.</p>

<p>I got a question about programming and wanted to ask something like ""What would be the best way to release a beta version of a plugin?"" Here I'm always not certain that a noun after the <strong>of</strong>, in this case, <strong>plugin</strong>, should have which article, a or the or none.</p>

<p>Which one is correct?</p>

<ol>
<li>""What would be the best way to release a beta version of <strong>a</strong> plugin?""</li>
<li>""What would be the best way to release a beta version of <strong>the</strong>
plugin?""</li>
<li>""What would be the best way to release a beta version of
plugin?""</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that <strong>a</strong> means one of many and <strong>the</strong> means a specific one. So I guess #1 is the correct sentence but I'm not sure. </p>

<p>Also if the sentence gets more details like ""What would be the best way to release a beta version of <strong>(a/the/none)</strong> plugin of WordPress?""</p>

<p>Then it becomes specific to WordPress so should the noun, plugin, have an article, the? But there are so many WordPress plugins in public. So it could be a; I don't know. </p>

<p>But what if the sentence is like ""What would be the best way to release a beta version of <strong>(a/the/none)</strong> plugin of WordPress which I'm currently working on?""</p>

<p>This one should be <strong>the</strong> I guess because it's very specific.</p>

<p>Thanks for your explanation.</p>

<p>In this case, it's specific to the speed on a server which uses WordPress caching feature. However, it could be many; there are lots of Web servers which installed WordPress and using the caching system. So it could be one of those. So I don't know if <em>a</em> could be applied here too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What he did was climb a tree</p>
</blockquote>

<p>on page 7 to illustrate the difference between a sentence and nonsentence.  The authors claim that the quoted sentence is grammatically correct, but I disagree. The problem I feel like is the word ""climb"". The quoted sentence has the basic structure of ""subject + linking verb + predicative expression"". Therefore what comes after the linking verb ""was"" can either be a gerund (""climbing the tree"") or a clause (""that he climbed a tree""), but not another verb. Also, it doesn't make any sense to interpret ""climb"" as a noun because I don't think the verb ""was"" can be followed by two predicative expressions.</p>

223678	A Question on Shakespeare's use of conditionals	"<p>The following is a big question, but I am really confused by the use of conditional in this Shakespearean excerpt. </p>

<p>From <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>, Act I, Scene I:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>142   I am agreed; and would I had given him the best</p>
  
  <p>143 horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would</p>
  
  <p>144   thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the</p>
  
  <p>145   house of her!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can someone help me parse out this conditional sentence? It seems that the modern English equivalent would be ""I would give the best horse to him who could woo her if I found this chosen man who can do so successfully."" </p>

<p>If my reading is correct, here is my doubt: Shakespeare uses 
A) <strong>would I had given</strong> as if he means it as the dependent clause whereas we, in MoE, usually change the word order this way in the dependent clause, as in: ""Had I known of the matter, I . . ."" Is there something I don't understand? </p>

<p>B) Since the time reference is the future, why <strong>would . . . had</strong> in the first place? Shouldn't it be ""I would""? </p>

<p>D) <strong>would . . . <em>had</em></strong>? Was this an 16th century equivalent to <strong>would . . . <em>have</em></strong>?   </p>

224395	Why is Greece not called in English by the name Hellas?	"<p>The Greeks call their country Hellas and themselves Hellenes. </p>

<p>The names <em>Greece</em> and <em>Greek</em> are of Roman origin and were adopted from Latin <em>Graecus</em> into old High German as <em>Crêch</em> and then in all Germanic languages the name was fashioned after the Latin -  Old English <em>Grécas</em>. (See OED extract below)</p>

<p>It has been the policy of the international community for many years to name new countries, (and rename old ones), to correspond with the way they are known to their own government and population. Thus <em>Abyssinia</em> became <em>Ethiopia</em>, the <em>Gold Coast</em> became <em>Ghana</em>, <em>Rhodesia</em> became (after partition) <em>Zambia</em> and <em>Zimbabwe</em>. (For a more complete list of name changes go to <a href=""http://www.conservapedia.com/Renamed_countries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conservapedia.com/Renamed_countries</a>.) </p>

<p>Since there may be some evidence that it was only colonists (presumably from Rome to Euboea) that assigned the name <em>Greece</em>, why do we continue to use that name and why not <em>Hellas</em>?  After all we no longer refer to the USA as <em>The thirteen colonies</em>.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forms:  pl.OE Cré(a)cas, Gré(a)cas, ME Greckes, Orm. Grickess, ME
  Greks, Grekis, ME Grekys... (Show More) Etymology:  In branch I: The
  Old English Crécas plural, corresponds to Old High German Chrêch ,
  Chriech (Middle High German Kriech ), Gothic Krêks < *Krêko-z , an
  early Germanic adoption of Latin Graecus , plural Graecī (see below),
  the name applied by the Romans to the people called by themselves
  Ἕλληνες . The substitution of k for g is commonly accounted for by the
  supposition that the Germanic initial g , when the word was adopted,
  still retained its original pronunciation /ɣ/ , so that k would be the
  Germanic sound nearest to the Latin g . In all the Germanic languages
  the word was ultimately refashioned after Latin, with change of k into
  g ; hence Old English Grécas plural beside Crécas , Middle Dutch
  Grieke (Dutch Griek ), modern German Grieche , Old Norse Grikkir ,
  plural. In branch II the noun is an absolute use of Greek adj. The
  Latin Graecī is < Greek Γραικοί, said by Aristotle ( Meteor. i. xiv)
  to have been the prehistoric name of the Hellenes in their original
  seats in Epirus. The word is apparently an adjectival derivative of
  Graius, which is used in Latin as a poetical synonym of Graecus.
  Recent scholars think the name may have been brought to Italy by
  colonists from Euboea, where there is some evidence of its having
  existed: see Busolt Gr. Gesch. I.2 198. (Show Less)  I.</p>

<p>I am confused about the usage of the words 'we' and 'us'. I am using a Princeton Review 11 SAT tests 2011 edition, practice test 7, section 6, number 29 (just in case anyone actually had that book).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>First, in <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, Chapter IV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Give me food,"" the other said, hoarsely. ""I have had no time for bite or sup for <strong>eight-and-forty hours</strong>."" He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's supper, and devoured it voraciously. ""Does Lucy bear up well?"" he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, in <em>The Sign of Four</em>, first in chapter II:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be <strong>seven-and-twenty</strong> now, — a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then in chapter VII:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their <strong>eight-and-twenty</strong> hours' start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These numbers may also be found in some short stories, such as <em>The Red-Headed League</em> and <em>The Five Orange Pips</em> (and probably others, but I might come across spoilers if I search further...). Additionally, I also found ""standard"" numbers, for instance when giving time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was <strong>twenty-five</strong> minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind. <em>(A Scandal in Bohemia)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>... and even when talking about age (even though my first quote of <em>The Sign of Four</em> uses the other form) :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of <strong>twenty-one</strong> years, are eligible. <em>(The Red-Headed League)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I understand that these respectively mean 48, 27 and 28, I am very curious two know more about this formulation, for instance: what is specific to the time? To some writers?

<p>The author is thus calling her (Daisy's) voice both an ""exhilarating ripple"" and ""a wild tonic."" To me, those ideas clash.</p>

<p>A colleague insists that this is a beautiful description of Daisy's voice and not, in fact, a mixed metaphor. </p>

<p>The definition of <strong>mixed metaphor</strong>, from Merriam-Webster online:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a metaphor that combines different images or ideas in a way that is foolish or illogical</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from Google dictionary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a combination of two or more incompatible metaphors, which produces a ridiculous effect</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, the sentence in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> combines different images or ideas, so is it simply a matter of personal opinion whether this combination is ""foolish"" or produces a ""ridiculous effect""?</p>

218157	Adjectives versus Noun Adjuncts	"<p>What determines whether something is a ""noun adjunct"" or just a garden-variety adjective?  Does it matter in any meaningful way?</p>

<p>Here is my hypothesis, but I can't find any authoritative source to back it up. I'm hoping someone here can weigh in more definitively.</p>

<ol>
<li>Classification of noun adjuncts is based <em>subjectively</em> on whether the word is in ""common usage"" as a noun.  ""Book"" and ""chicken"" are commonly nouns and would be considered noun adjuncts in ""book collector"" and ""chicken soup""; ""yellow"", not so much.</li>
<li>Noun adjuncts may share some common qualities that differentiate them from other adjectives (like not being able to be inflected into superlative forms... one can't be a ""book-est collector"").  But they are still fundamentally <em>adjectives</em> and may even appear in the dictionary as such if the adjectival usage is common enough.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I've found so far...</p>

<p>Wikipedia defines a ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_adjunct"" rel=""nofollow"">noun adjunct</a>"" as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an optional noun that modifies another noun; it is a noun functioning as an adjective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But English words are not decreed to be nouns or adjectives by some higher authority.  So it seems strange that one can prescriptively conclude that something ""is a noun"" in the first place, let alone extrapolate that it ""is a noun functioning as an adjective"".</p>

<p>The wiki article cites ""chicken soup"" as an example of a noun adjunct, but at least <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chicken?s=t"" rel=""nofollow"">one dictionary</a> gives a definition for ""chicken"" as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>adj. (of food) containing, made from, or having the flavor of chicken</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that there are some differing points of view on how to categorize these words.</p>

<p>There are people who are blessed with a remarkable knowledge of vocabulary and diction – people who can come up with beautifully crafted sentences and expressions on most subjects at the drop of a hat.

One thing that makes the peruse-the-dictionary approach even slower than what one would obviously expect is that the etymology of one of the words is often ""origin unknown"" (such as the two noun meanings of ""drill"").

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buy iPhone at your favorite Apple Retail Store.</p>

<p>My initial impression after reading this would be to interpret ""iPhone"" as its own plural, like ""deer"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now iPhone is even bigger on productivity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now it can't be exactly like ""deer"", as you would expect to see ""iPhone are"", ""the iPhone"" or ""an iPhone"".</p>

<p>So looking at both examples together, my next thought would be that perhaps ""iPhone"" is a mass noun, like ""data"". Substituting ""data"" in either sentence seems acceptable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...we could have sold many more iPhones...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now they've made ""iPhone"" plural. I'm not sure how you could fit ""data"" into this sentence other than the slightly odd ""datums"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new iPhones include iOS 8...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and now ""iPhone"" finally has an article. The only word I can think of that can go in all of these sentences now is ""coffee"", but I'm not sure this is actually the same. ""Coffee"" seems to have the odd property that ""a coffee"" is different from ""coffee"", ""a coffee"" always means ""some coffee in a vessel"", and ""coffees"" is always the plural of the ""a coffee"" form even if you omit the article (as in ""Coffees are expensive."", which is distinct from ""Coffee is expensive."").</p>

<p>The ë in the name Zoë suggests that the e should be pronounced as a long a.  The name is from the Greek goddess of life and the Greek word for life.  My name is Zoë.  It was my birth middle name, and I changed it to my last name.  Many people discuss the proper pronunciation, but the correct answer should come from the person who has the name.  My mother gave me the name, and that was her pronunciation.  I discovered that the French pronounce it that way; however, my family wasn't French.  Also, I know that Americans pronounce it Zo with a long o.  The Greeks pronounce it Zo-e with a long e and accent over Zo.</p>

<p>I am looking for a word to describe that which is created from a template.</p>

<p>I am writing software which is used for testing. I created an object which can be used as a template for actual tests. These 'implementations' (as I have called them) just pass a few parameters to the template and the template is executed. It is important to recognise an implementation as such and to be able to refer back to the template as this is where the actual actions are performed.</p>

<p>I am not happy with the word 'implementation' as I find it too general. Is there a better word I could use? Bear in mind that the end user has to create (implement?) the template itself before template-implementations can be created. It gets a bit confusing.

<p>In Letter #163 to W.H. Auden  from page 214 of <em>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</em>, Tolkien mentions his mother noting but not explaining that one had to say <em>‘a <strong>great green</strong> dragon’</em> instead of the other way around:</p>

<p>Book V Chapter XVII: ""Sixteenth Year of the War—The Melian Conference—Fate of Melos""</p>

<p>is known as the Melian Dialogue, and is one of the most famous portions of one of the greatest books of antiquity.</p>

<p>Wikipedia describes it under the heading ""Melian Dialogue"" as follows:</p>

<p>""The Melian dialogue takes place fifteen years into the Peloponnesian war, during the confrontation in 416–415 BC between the Athenians and the people of Melos, a small island located in the southern Aegean Sea just east of Sparta. The Athenians demanded that the Melians surrender their city and pay them tribute or face the destruction of their city. The Melians claimed their right to remain neutral, appealing to the Athenians' sense of decency and mercy toward a small, peaceful, and defenseless city.""</p>

<p>The Athenians said to the Melians:</p>

<p>""you know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.""</p>

<p>The Melians refused to surrender, so the Athenians defeated them, killed the adult men, and sold the women and children into slavery.</p>

<p>I'm an EFL (English as a foreign language) teacher and I haven't been able to come up with a good principle for which preposition to use after <em>get</em> when referring to transportation.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<li>Get in:
<ul>
<li>a car/taxi/van/truck, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get on:
<ul>
<li>a bus/plane/bike/truck, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How can one choose whether to use <em>in</em> or <em>on</em>? Note that in some cases, such as the example with <em>truck</em>, either preposition is possible but the choice affects the meaning.</p>

<p>First of all, I'd like to say I hope that this won't be considered completely out of topic as my question is rather general (and too long) but after all, I don't know where else to ask if not here.</p>

<p>I'm a non-native speaker (Czech) and in the process of learning I, obviously, encountered a number of cases when I wasn't sure and asked the teacher, a native speaker, or looked the answer up in a book. No problem so far.</p>

<p>I later became an English teacher myself (thank god, those days are gone :) and started being asked various questions, too. This wasn't a problem either - I answered them according to the books and sometimes added a little more of what I knew about ""real-life"" usage.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the more you learn about any language (including your own), the more you realize that there are certain truths written in books that are rather simplifications and generalizations - needed for the student to be able to learn things without being overwhelmed by too much information but not precise and exact facts.</p>

<p>That wouldn't be a problem either. It's obvious that you can't discuss all details at the very beginning. But to my surprise (which still lasts), I also found out that there was actually no standardization authority that would have a final say in terms of what is right and what is wrong.</p>

<p>And if you study English books carefully, you will realize that even Cambridge (as the main English testing authority in mainland Europe) and Oxford (as the unofficial language authority) often differ in their interpretations of what is correct and what is not. And American English (which I tend to use) doesn’t even seem to have these.</p>

<p>I do understand that there are big differences not only among American, British, Australian, Canadian, South African... variations of the language but even among regions, classes etc. But someone from a country like mine would somewhat automatically expect that at least for each country there would be an ""ultimate authority"" which could say that I should use this or that if I want to speak/write correctly.</p>

<p>There are a lot of different dialects in the Czech Republic. Surprisingly many for such a small country. And that's perfectly fine. But if you're not sure what the standard, formal form is, there is the ""Dictionary of Standard Czech"" and the ""Rules of the Czech Language"" where you find the ultimate answer. And if you don't, there is the ""Institute for the Czech Language"" where you can get answers even to the most complicated questions. Germans have the same for their language (remember the argument over the sharp s not so long ago) and I believe so do most European countries.</p>

<p>If you've read this far, you must be curious what my question actually is. OK, here it comes: is all the language talk really just a matter of personal preference or is there any source of information that I can consider final? Does correctness really depend only on how often something is used?</p>

<p>To pick just a few “ever green examples”, is ""better than I"" or ""better than me"" correct? Who’s the one to say that “color” is American while “colour” is British or Canadian? When my American friends say ""If I would've done that"", can they argue that it's correct just because it's used where they're from? Where can I find the line between “generally used” and “accepted as grammatically correct”?</p>

<p>And an additional question: have there ever been attempts (that probably failed) to introduce a general English authority that would have the final say?</p>

<p>I have absolutely nothing against colloquial, slang, spoken language. Actually, who doesn't use it and tries to be hypercorrect at any cost sounds like a moron. But there are moments when you want to consult someone you can trust. And no offense to this site (which I really love) but the answers often resemble rather personal opinions than definite facts. And therefore I'm asking this question to which there is probably no true, correct answer. But it was biting my brain for too long so it had to get out.</p>

216590	Why is a person 'on' public transport and not 'in' it	"<p>A friend of mine recently posted a comment on Facebook saying that the phrase <em>""on a train""</em> is a pet peeve of his since it very rarely refers to somebody literally riding on top of a train.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about the prepositions used for other forms of transport and I noticed a pattern where ""on"" seems to be used for all forms of public transport even when it sounds like it should be technically incorrect (bus, plane) but only for private transport where it is technically correct ('on' for bike but 'in' for car).</p>

<p>Curious to see if there were any answer out there as to why this is I found a previous question that specifically related to trains <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/14242/on-the-train-or-in-the-train"">""on the train"" or ""in the train""?</a>. Most of the answers related to <strong>what</strong> the correct preposition is rather than <strong>why</strong> but one of the top rated answers suggested that on is used to distinguish between a stated of having boarded a train from being a component of a train. I'm not entirely sure I agree with this answer but it also doesn't really apply to other forms of public transport.</p>

<p>My best guess is that the use of 'on' is a remnant from a time when it would have been correct for most forms of mass transport (cart, boat) but I'd be interested to know if there is any other reason.</p>

216138	Pronoun Agreement	"<p>Lately, I've been trying to understand the use of pronoun agreement in depth. While in the process I came across this <a href=""http://chompchomp.com/rules/proagreerules.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>.</p>

<p>According to the Author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Professional writers might revise the sentence so that a
  pronoun is unnecessary. Sometimes, they make the antecedent plural so
  that they can use the natural-sounding <em>they</em>, <em>them</em>, or <em>their</em>. Or they
  might decide to alternate <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> in the piece so that both genders
  get mentioned.</p>
  
  <p>Using <em>he or she</em> or <em>him or her</em> is technically correct. But it's also
  bad style. Avoid these constructions if you can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of following example, what are ways you could avoid using <em>his or her</em> pronoun?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone should take his or her seat.</p>

244761	Is the clause “where are you from” grammatically correct?	"<p>One of the most fundamental sentence from the English “phrasebook” that almost every beginner will learn is this sentence, using which one can ask another one’s nationality or country/region of origin.  However, this sentence has always troubled me.  </p>

<p>The word <em>where</em> is an adverb in this context, and it functions as an adverbial; <em>from</em> is a preposition, and it functions as part of the subjective complement in this sentence.  Id est, when responding to this clause, people may say, for example, “I am from Milan.”  Now, in that response, <em>I</em> is a pronoun functioning as the subject, and the rest of the sentence, <em>am from Milan</em>, is the predicate, which is comprised of the copula, or the linking verb, <em>am</em>, and the subjective complement, <em>from Milan</em>, which is a spatial adverbial.  </p>

<p>What I have learned about English grammar prescribes that an interrogative/relative adverb, such as <em>where</em> or <em>when</em>, cannot follow a preposition, because an adverb alone functions as an adverbial, and the structure “preposition + noun/pronoun” ought to correspond to an adverb.  Id est, the phrase <em>from Milan</em> (preposition + noun) can and should correspond to that adverb <em>where</em>, and structures such as <em>from where</em> are illegitimate.  </p>

<p>I think it is fairly common that adverbs do not follow prepositions.  People always say clauses such as <em>where are you <strong>at</em></strong> is grammatically incorrect, because <em>at</em> is a preposition and <em>where</em> is an adverb, so it should simply be <em>where are you</em>.  Therefore, what troubles me is that why the phrase <em>where are you at</em> is incorrect and criticized, while I have not seen people avoiding <em>where are you from</em>.  </p>

<p>In my humble opinion, the canonical form of this clause should be <em>from which country/region are you</em>, or at least <em>which country/region are you from</em>, but it seems awfully pedantic and there is a highly probable chance that the utterer will get thrashed…</p>

"<p>I watched a clip a show shown on TruTV about a woman who was angry about not having been offered free cash for thirty days.  According to the receptionist in the financial services place she was in, the sign she (the disgruntled customer) read meant that one can receive a loan free of interest within a 30-day span.  However, the sign reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>INTEREST LOANS<br>

     Get 30 days of interest free cash!</p>

103914	Plural form of Octopus and Radius	"<p>I have recently found this video online from Merriam Webster saying the plural form of octopus is in fact octopuses. The video explains how octopus comes from the Greek language and thus it would be incorrect to say octopi since that is a latin plural form. The Greek plural of octopus would be octopodes, but octopus actually turns into an English word which makes the plural octopuses.</p>

<p>With that being said, why do dictionaries have octopi listed as the plural form if that is incorrect? Is the plural so widely misused that they just threw in octopi in there?</p>

<p>And then there is the Latin word radius. No one ever uses the word radiuses however it is listed in the dictionary. In fact, even my google chrome and firefox spell checker tells me radiuses is incorrect. Is this word never meant to be used? Despite radius also being an English word, people will always say radii for the plural version.</p>

103866	Pronunciation of '-ing' endings as '-een'	"<p>Recently my daughter told us she’d had a supply teacher at school because her regular teacher was “at home pukin’.”</p>

<p>The pronunciation of the -ing ending as <em>in’</em> [ɪn] (rather than [ɪŋ]) seems to be fairly region-dependent, and often appears in North America, if I’m not mistaken, in rural areas such as the one I live in (and in researching this question, I see that the pronunciation has <a href=""http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000878.html"" rel=""nofollow"">long historical roots</a>).</p>

<p>My daughter’s pronunciation got me thinking about another pronunciation of the -ing ending that I have noticed occasionally throughout my life: <em>een</em> [in]. (“I’m <em>walkeen</em> to school,” or “Why are you <em>runneen</em> so quickly?”). Unlike the <em>in’</em> pronunciation, <em>een</em> does not appear, to my observations, to be dependent on either region or class, nor even generation. It doesn’t get caricaturized in song lyrics or on greeting cards. It doesn't even seem to run in families! When I’ve mentioned this pronunciation to other people, many haven’t even noticed it (“She says <em>runneen</em>? I never noticed before.”) </p>

<p>I don’t <em>think</em> I have heard a Brit pronounce it. But I have certainly heard Canadians and Americans from various ages, social classes and regions pronounce this <em>een</em> ending consistently. A few, not many.</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking that this pronunciation is not associated with any particular region, generation or social class?
If so, under what circumstances does it occur in a person’s speech?
Does it occur outside of North America?
Does it have any history?</p>

<p>While researching this question I came upon this <a href=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3459"" rel=""nofollow"">Language Log post</a> in which Sarah Palin’s pronunciation of “shackling” as ['ʃæklin] is much discussed (but without answers to my questions). There is also a recording her pronunciation. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3037"" rel=""nofollow"">This Language Log post</a> appears to address this phenomenon. The author concludes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[As far as I know] there are no systematic studies of this range of
  phenomena. As I mentioned, it's part of the folklore of

241044	Hopefully vs Presumably	"<h3>Background</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>hopefully</strong> (adverb): in a hopeful manner</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Presumably</strong> (adverb): used to convey that what is asserted is very likely though not known for certain.</p></li>
<li><p>While fully acknowledging, as noted in <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1521"">the discussion about the correct usage of hopefully</a>, that hopefully is accepted in standard usage as a sentence modifier and as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunct_(linguistics)"" rel=""nofollow"">disjunct</a>; I wonder about the etymology and more precise historical differences in the usage between <em>hopefully</em> and <em>presumably</em>. </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Question based on background</h3>

<p>Why is it correct to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Presumably it is true...""   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and incorrect to say  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hopefully it is true..."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, why would the latter sentence be corrected to:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I am hopeful that it is true..."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>which does not mean the same thing; 
whereas the former could be changed to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I am presuming it is true...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which does mean the same thing?  </p>

<p>Put one other way, why is it standard (and I believe acceptable) English to assume an implicit verb when using presumably: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I think presumably that it is true...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where presumably is modifying the verb think to mean that the thought is one which is thought presumptuously or in a presuming manner.  </p>

<p>Yet it is not accepted that ""I think"" is assumed as in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I think hopefully that it is true...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where hopefully is modifying the verb think to mean that the thought is one which is thought hopefully or in a hopeful manner.</p>

<p>Or is it the case that presumably is just as frequently misused as hopefully and that both are incorrect? If that usage of presumably outlined above is accepted as grammatically correct, is there some etymological reason for this usage?</p>

<p>Presumably someone must know the answer to this question. I await members' replies hopefully.</p>

<p>This is probably something that economists would quickly recognize. It often happens that people would wrongly speculate something; for example, a sudden rise in gold prices, and as a result of that speculation, the buyers will rush to buy gold in a bid to escape the anticipated rise in price whereas the sellers will hold it back looking forward to the  price rise. The sudden demand for gold, on one hand, and the shortage of supply on the other, will eventually bring about the rise in its price.</p>

<p>I have no idea what I’m doing.  Catch as catch can.  “Saute” seems correct to me, but I was <em>clobbered</em> by someone who insisted I was “just ignorant”.  (I won’t argue that.)</p>

<p>I assume purists will insist the accent pretty much always be used for foreign loan words.  But... I’m writing in <em>English</em>.  It just seems like it should be okay to incorporate “saute”, and the other words, as native English words pretty much as soon as you start using them and people know what you’re talking about.  This seems to me less of an offense than, say, willfully “misspelling” tire vs. tyre.</p>

<p>I prefer Strunk’s application of the serial comma for logical reasons, yet this goes against common accepted practice.  So I don’t see all such things as black and white.  I’m just curious if a case can be made for saute?  [And I can stuff this thread up my friend’s rather beautiful upturned snoot!]</p>

<p>Sure, at first glance it’s just “ignorant” (we are so petrified of <em>that</em>), but on the far side is it not better to accept simplicity if still clearly understood?</p>

239269	Last, This, and Next (days of the week)	"<p>I (and my interlocutors) have often experienced confusion when communicating with others regarding ""last [day-of-week]"", ""this [day-of-week]"" and ""next [day-of-week]""</p>

<p>In my mind, what is logical is that ""last"" means the last one (the one in the most recent past); ""this"" means the next one coming up; and ""next"" is the second one from now.</p>

<p>""This"" to me denotes the future - it points forward in time.</p>

<p>For example, today is Tuesday, April 14th. If I say, ""last Saturday"" I mean April 11th; if I say, ""this Saturday"" I mean April 18th; and if I say ""next Saturday"" I mean April 25th - although I admit it gets a little ambiguous when ""this"" saturday is several days away. But I would definitely be speaking of the 22nd if I were to say, ""next Wednesday"" (not the 15th, for that is tomorrow, and to say ""next"" would sound/seem bizarre to me.</p>

<p>Note/Addendum: I would not say ""last Monday"" for yesterday, because in that case I simply say that (""yesterday""); similary, I would not call tomorrow ""this Wednesday"" for a similar reason - I refer to that simply as ""tomorrow"".</p>

<p>I find, though, that many people consider ""this Monday"" to have been yesterday (the 13th), not ""this <em>coming</em>"" Monday (which is how I see it).</p>

<p>I do recognize some logic in this alternate viewpoint provided everybody were to agree that the ""this"" refers to a current week, beginning on Sunday, or Monday, depending on which day is considered a week's beginning point (and so, the differing standard in regards to that question is a matter of contention/confusion in and of itself).</p>

<p>Another way of expressing it, I guess, would be to say that I always consider myself as being in a sliding scale of time, rather than in a particular calendar week, one which stays fixed for an entire week. In other words, today I am in a week that runs from Tuesday the 14th through Monday the 20th. Tomorrow I will be in a week that runs from Wednesday the 15th  through Tuesday 21st, etc. Others apparently always view themselves as being somewhere in a week that runs either from Sunday-Saturday, or Monday-Sunday.</p>

<p>Am I definitely wrong in my take on ""last, this, and next"" or is it just ""different strokes for different folks""? I'm curious how many others (if any?) view time from ""my"" perspective?</p>

<p>The bottom line is, I always find it beneficial to mention specific dates. So, instead of saying just ""this Monday"" I say, ""this Monday, the 20th""</p>

238206	Usage of Waste and Wastage	"<p>is there any difference between these two words?</p>

<p>I understand that people often use ""food waste"" to talk about the issue of throwing away too many cooked food</p>

<p>However, it seems to me that it would be more accurate to describe it as ""food wastage"".</p>

<p>Another interesting point is about an implicit connotation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dictionary.com states that: Waste and wastage are to some extent interchangeable, but many people think that wastage should not be used to refer to loss resulting from human carelessness, inefficiency, etc: a waste (not a wastage) of time/money/effort etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>however, when I refer to another book or, such connotation is not acknowledged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the Guide to English Usage states that: wastage = act or process of wasting; whereas waste  = unused remnant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can anyone explain to me the difference regarding the two words?</p>

"<p>I heard an American speaking on the BBC World at One news this lunchtime,  about the Greek debt. He was arguing that the character of a lot of Greece's debt is quite different to that of other debtor nations and that if comparable accounting methods were used they would be able to claim a debt level of less than 20% of GDP. (This is quite a radical opinion and not one accepted by the IMF, incidentally.)</p>

<p>He then made a statement the syntax of which made me sit up from eating my lunch. He said <strong><em>If they would have recognised this it would have saved them a lot of trouble</em></strong>.

<p>The total cost savings, TCS, are estimated to be $100.</p>

<p>In both situations, ""is"" seems like it should be the verb and not ""are"". Furthermore, in the context of the the two example sentences above, the savings is a static number. Also, ""is"" sounds right when just using the abbreviations. When savings is used by itself I agree that the correct verb is ""are"" but when savings is part of a name that suggests to me that it will be have as a singular noun. Thanks.</p>

113762	A Revelation (?) from MS Word	"<p>So, I typed the parenthetic statement 'Asked why did he come here'. Microsoft Word suggested that I change the sentence to 'Asked why he came here'. I agreed with the correction, but when I had word explain the change, the following came up: </p>

<p>Order of Words
If your sentence includes a statement about a question rather than a direct question, the subject should come before the verb.</p>

<p>It then went on to give these examples: </p>

<p>Instead of: He asked the bus driver when would the next bus come.
Consider: He asked the bus driver when the next bus would come.</p>

<p>Instead of: I wonder what did they serve for lunch.
Consider: I wonder what they served for lunch.</p>

236197	"A more polite/formal way of saying ""contact us, we will get back to you"""	"<p>I'm doing some language correction for my mom's company website. While my English is much better than hers, I'm not a native speaker, and I've never really focused on business English in my studies. I'm rewriting a short introduction to the company, and I came across a sentence that basically means ""contact us, tell us what you want, we'll make you an offer asap"". So far I have </p>

<p>""We will get back to you with our offer in the shortest time possible."" </p>

<p>For some reason, the ""We will get back to you"" part strikes me as not very formal. It feels colloquial. It doesn't seem to fit with the style and and the level of formality required by the context.</p>

<p>I may be wrong about this, it's just a hunch. Again, I'm not a native speaker. So is there a way to say this more politely? Or is this form acceptable?</p>

<p>EDIT:
the answer to the other question suggests I use ""contact you"". And since the preceding sentence reads ""Don't hesitate to contact us"", I'd end up with ""contact us ... we'll contact you"", which is just bad stylistics. 
Another suggested answer is ""reach out"" but again, this doesn't have the right connotation (of back-and-forth) with regards to the preceding sentence. I realize now I should have included that sentence in the original question. So really what I need is to transform ""Contact us, we'll get back to you"" to ""Contact us, we'll [...]"", [...] being the more formal version.</p>

  <p>Nelson Lund, a professor of law at George Mason University, argues that everything before the second comma is an “absolute phrase” and, therefore, does not modify anything in the main clause. Professor Lund states that the Second Amendment “has exactly the same meaning that it would have if the preamble had been omitted.”</p>
  
  <p>But, according to the journalist, Professor Lund is correct that the clause about a well-regulated militia is “absolute,” but only in the sense that it is grammatically independent of the main clause, not that it is logically unrelated. To the contrary, absolute clauses typically provide a causal or temporal context for the main clause.</p>

114263	Which one to use as general Personal Pronoun: he, she or it	"<h2>The issue</h2>

<p>On my mother language, Portuguese, we have a lot of little differences to English on Pronouns.</p>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>Which phrase is correct? Since I don't know if user is a man or a woman (or a bot), which pronoun I have to use after the comma punctuation?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every time a user replies the e-mail, he receives error notifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time a user replies the e-mail, she receives error notifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time a user replies the e-mail, it receives error notifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time a user replies the e-mail, man receives error notifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Every time users reply the e-mail, they receive error notifications.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>The mess</h2>

<p>On Portuguese, ""user"" = ""usuário"", that is a male noun, so I think that 1st option is correct.</p>

<p>But changing ""user"" by ""person"" = ""pessoa"", that is a female person, I think that the 2nd option is the correct.</p>

<p>I don't know if ""it"" (3rd option) can be use to generalize to male, female and objects in English...</p>

<p>On Portuguese, we can generalize it using another type of pronoun, ""se"", that can function like ""man"" on English (4th option), but I don't know if it is appropriate to use as a general pronoun or if it cause some confusion with a male person...</p>

<p>Or I can use only the 5th option?</p>

<p>""it"" doesn't have a direct correspondent word on Portuguese as ""Personal Pronoun"":</p>

<pre><code>English   Portuguese    Meaning
-------   ----------    -------
""he""    = ""ele""      -> A male person
""she""   = ""ela""      -> A female person
""it""    = ""ele""      -> An object that has a male Portuguese noun
""it""    = ""ela""      -> An object that has a female Portuguese noun
</code></pre>

<p>Well, we can use another type of pronoun, ""Demonstrative Pronoun"" (similar to ""this"" and ""that""), to have the same meaning as ""it"":</p>

<pre><code>English          Portuguese   Meaning
--------------   ----------   -------
""it"" = ""this""  = ""isto""       A thing near first person (I)
""it"" = ""these"" = ""isto""       Some things near first person (I)

""it"" = ""that""  = ""isso""       A thing near second person (you)
""it"" = ""those"" = ""isso""       Some things near second person (you)

""it"" = ""that""  = ""aquilo""     A thing far from first and second persons
""it"" = ""those"" = ""aquilo""     Some things far from first and second persons

"<p>As a math and computer-science person, I use the phrase ""more optimal"" quite often, such as <em>""This algorithm gives more optimal results.""</em>  However, I was recently corrected, and told that <em>""more optimal""</em> is incorrect grammar, since ""optimal"" means ""best,"" and something can't be ""more best.""</p>

In <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/4A0CC076.7030207@emolecules.com"" rel=""nofollow"">this pointless flame war</a>, someone suggests that the correct phrase is <em>""more optimized""</em> or <em>""better optimized,""</em> while <a href=""http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~karplus/185/w99/reader/A_Grammar_and_format.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> suggests using <em>""more nearly optimal.""</em>  </p>

<p>For example, as opposed to: ""It's your beating me in chess that angered me."" a sentence such as: ""It's like you beating me in chess: it'll never happen."" </p>

<p>It raises a circumstance that is in theory, so I don't think anything can be attributed to it. The chess match hasn't been won yet, so the listener does not yet ""possess"" the win. </p>

<p>Another way I could expound upon it is as ""A case of you beating me in chess."" I don't think this would take the possessive because it's not definite. </p>

<p>Or does it not matter? Would the possessive form of the pronoun be used regardless, and, if so, is it a set rule?</p>

<p>*<em>EDIT</em>*They're both gerunds, but the meanings are changed because of their syntax. The former represents a case where a reason is provided, involving an embedded gerund and the effect. It's the normal situation that's been addressed. </p>

<p>The second is a situation that has not been experienced while it's being said. In a sentence like ""I'm frightened by his reddening."" it's the typical gerund with a prevedent possessive, all in the present-tense. </p>

<p>""The idea of him reddening."" is another type of sentence, altoghether. And on purpose, too. I doubt the answer is the same as that question from the threas that was compared to this one. </p>

<p>Try: ""The situation of [a person] [verb-ing]."" In other words, the situation where one is performing a verb. Suddenly, the possessive seemls unneeded. </p>

<p>Compare it to: ""A person's [own] [doing a verb](The respective activity attributed to their behavior.).</p>

<p>Could anyone please consider the following uses? In each case I am  trying to explain how I see it, any corrections or answers are welcome. (Maybe somebody has links to some pieces of texts, where each article is explained, if so then please post a link here)</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(<strong>1</strong>)The potential disruptions in (<strong>2</strong>)the functioning of (<strong>3</strong>) an integrated global monetary system could result in (<strong>4</strong>)a renewed global economic meltdown as well as (<strong>5</strong>)a drop off in (<strong>6</strong>)international commodity trade.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Perhaps disruptions were mentioned earlier? But if they were not, does it mean that they are specific? (we know that they stem from ""...the functioning of..."" and that they ""could result in..."")</p></li>
<li><p>As I understand, we can use <em>the</em> before a noun if it is followed by ""of something""?</p></li>
<li><p>Isn't ""integrated global monetary system"" something unique? (thus requring using <em>the</em>).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>B.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This global oversupply of commodities is (<strong>1</strong>)a  direct consequence of the decline in purchasing power and rising levels of poverty [.] (<strong>2</strong>)Oversupply contributes in turn to the further depression of the earnings of the direct producers through the closure of excess productive capacity. </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Isn't ""direct consequence"" something specific? It is indicated what is the essence of this consequence (that is, ""global oversupply"") and we can see that the consequence occurred due to ""the decline in"" . This question correlates with <strong>A</strong>.(<strong>2</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>The absence of the definite article in (<strong>2</strong>) is not clear. Maybe it is a mistake. Maybe it is an uncountable, general noun. However, could (or should) we use <em>the</em> as we have a connection with the previously mentioned ""global oversupply"". The second sentence sounds for me like ""[this] oversupply contributes..."" </p></li>

<p><strong>C.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The legal basis for CEEPUS is (<strong>1</strong>)an international Agreement signed by the member states and open for accession.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Isn't a particular ""international agreement(that was signed...and then serving as ""the legal basis"" for a particular thing )"" implied here (thus, requiring <em>the</em>)? </li>

<blockquote>

However can we use zero article if we are talking, for example, about any and all students (that is, indefinite 'population' of students) who are interested in this program.  </p></li>
<li><p>Why is <em>the</em> used? I can assume that these insights were mentioned somewhere earlier (in other sections describing this particular program). Or <em>the</em> is used because they are  somewhat particular insights, that is ""essential insights ... to analyse [smth]"" however these 'insights' still sound to me like an abstract concept - infinite set of such essential insights. (And not a particular set of some cognitive processes) because there is not any strong description of them. Each student can obtain a different set of skills/methods and a different level of knowledge to analyse the problems. Thus there can be infinite set of such essential insights.</p></li>

<li>I ain't no magician sir, I'm just a technical person.</li>

231863	"Pronoun + ""would rather"" + (pro)noun + verb: what is a grammatical structure of such phrases?"	"<p>In George R. R. Martin's <em>A Game Of Thrones</em>, there is a moment when one character says the following words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So the slaver has become a spy. I would rather he become a corpse.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I understand the general meaning of it: that the speaker would prefer that person to be dead rather than spying around. What I don't understand is the exact grammar behind the second sentence of the example below.</p>

<p>From what I know, <em>rather</em> is an adverb, so the main clause doesn't have a predicate and technically is incomplete. And since there is a common language structure ""pronoun + would rather + verb1 (+ than + verb2)"", like <em>I would rather die (than do it)</em>, I assume that in my example is used some specific shortened form of a more verbose construction, like it's the case with <em>would that i could</em>. Am I correct? If so, then what is the full form of it?</p>

<p>Also, I'm not entirely sure in what tense <em>become</em> is used in the second sentence. Is it a subjunctive present form, or some shortened form of present perfect that was used in the first sentence, or maybe something else entirely?</p>

<p>And one more thing. When ""would rather"" is used like in the example above, does it imply some, I don't know how to say it, temporal reference, i.e. <strong>when</strong> the action described by the verb that follows it should happen or should have happened? In other words, in my example, does the speaker express a wish to see that person dead already or simply want him to die at any time in the future?</p>

<p><a href=""http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/each"" rel=""nofollow"">Cambridge Dictionaries Online</a> says <em>each</em> is used as an <strong>adverb</strong> in the following examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are five leaflets – please take one of <em>each</em>.<br>
   <em>Each</em> of the brothers has a different personality.<br>
   It’s 500 miles <em>each</em> way.<br>
   The bill comes to $80, so that’s $20 <em>each</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/each"" rel=""nofollow"">Oxford Dictionaries</a> says <em>each</em> is a <strong>determiner</strong> and a <strong>pronoun</strong> in the following</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>each one</em> of us was asked what went on (determiner)<br>
    Derek had money from <em>each</em> of his five uncles (pronoun)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/each"" rel=""nofollow"">Merriam-Webster</a>'s entry for <em>each</em> states it is an <strong>adjective</strong>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A rope was tied to <em>each</em> end of the boat.<br>
  <em>Each</em> student had a different explanation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a <strong>pronoun</strong>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He took shot after shot, <em>each</em> missing by inches   </p>

  <p>They cost 50 cents <em>each</em>.<br>
  We were allowed two tries <em>each</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_pronoun"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> tells me that <em>each</em> is an <strong>indefinite pronoun</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>and <a href=""http://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/indefinite_adjectives.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Grammar Monster</a> (which btw I really like) says that <em>each</em> is an <strong>indefinite adjective</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An indefinite adjective is used to describe a noun in a non-specific
  sense.</p>
  
  <p>The most common indefinite adjectives are: any, <strong>each</strong>, few, many, much,
  most, several, and some.
  They are often used to describe a noun to show an element of uncertainty.</p>
  
  <p>Indefinite adjectives should not be confused with indefinite pronouns. <strong>Indefinite adjectives modify nouns or pronouns</strong>. Indefinite pronouns are standalone pronouns</p>

<h2>QUESTIONS</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>For sentence No. 1, I cannot find a satisfying ""tag"" to place on <em>each</em>. Since the word ""each"" is placed at the end of a sentence, I suppose it must be an adverb but it feels like a quantifier to me because it tell me <em>how many</em> books, i.e. <em>to each of my friends</em>. Is <em>each</em> in No.1 an adverb? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Sentence 2 is definitely a pronoun. </p></li>
<li><p>For sentences 3, 4, and 5 ""each of"" and ""each one of"" can be substituted with <strong><em>all of</em></strong>, with no loss in meaning. But are <em>each of</em> and <em>each one of</em> pronouns? If we use a <em>pronoun</em> to replace a noun phrase or a noun, then how can <em>each</em> in: <strong><em>each (one) of my friends</em></strong> be a pronoun? And I imagine it can't be an <em>indefinite pronoun</em> because we know exactly ""how many"" people in sentence 3. Oxford Dictionaries suggest that <em>each of</em> is a pronoun but <em>each one of</em> is a determiner. </p></li>
<li><p>In sentence 6 <em>each</em> is an adjective/determiner/indefinite adjective because it tells us something about the number of friends. <em>Right</em>?</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Representative Adam B. Schiff was uncomfortable with much of what he
  has seen floated, especially the lack of a 2001 repeal. “If you don’t
  <strong>sunset</strong> that” he said, “any <strong>sunset</strong> you put in a new authorization is
  pretty meaningless because any president can rely on the 2001

"<p>In the USA, where I live, it is becoming increasingly common that men and women are making committed relationship decisions, but choosing to remain unmarried. However, they live together, raise children together, and otherwise appear married. They are simply not legally married and they are okay with it and so are most other Americans. It is obvious that they are highly involved with each other and the depth of their relationship is akin to a long standing marriage.</p>

230280	Gerunds - Should they be a word class of their own?	"<p>I'm a bit astonished about the long discussions in the post How can I prove a word is a noun? I admit that there a certain problems, especially with gerunds.</p>

<ul>
<li>Smoking cigarettes is unhealty.</li>

<p>In this example, containing a gerund with an object, it is indeed a bit difficult to say to which word class ""smoking"" belongs. Is it a noun or a verb?</p>

<p>Traditionally the gerund is seen as a verb form with a double nature. It can behave as a noun and as a verb.</p>

<p>I think it would be practical to see the gerund also as a special word class, a noun-verb thing. In this way we could avoid a lot of problems that arise about the word class noun when we come across gerunds with objects.</p>

122473	Idiom for random/arbitatry decision making	"<p>Sometimes an entity's (be it a person, company, or a government) predictions/choices/decisions seem to be completely arbitrary (based on no evidence or observation).</p>

<p>A very colorful example of this is <a href=""http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s13e03-margaritaville"" rel=""nofollow"">South Park's Margaritaville episode</a>. When learning that a bank is going bankrupt, a board of judges or whatever decapitate a chicken, and throws its beheaded body into a pit divided into different areas with actions written on them, such as ""Bail out"", ""Do nothing"", ""Pay $10000"", ""Sue"", etc. The headless chicken runs around for a while until it finally drops motionless on one of the areas in the pit. The judges' verdict is based on where the dead chicken lands. </p>

<p>In Armenian we have an idiom ""մատից հոտ քաշել"", which literally means ""to smell one's finger"". Smelling one's finger, of course, does not give one any useful informations, so basing one's forecasts/choices on the ""results"" of smelling one's finger is completely random and arbitrary. For example, in Armenian one could say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't trust the weather forecast. I think they simply smell their finger and come up with a prediction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does he know all this?<br>
  He doesn't, he just smelled his finger. (i.e. his claims are based on nothing)</p>

260349	Grammar - Scientific English (Physics)	"<p>I have a question about scientific English. I wonder when to use the article <strong>""the""</strong> when you refer to a physical quantity or to a formula. I promise that I have looked into so many manuals, but I am still terribly puzzled.</p>

<p>As I compared many textbooks and scientific articles, let's start from the cases I am sure about.</p>

<p>One always reads:</p>

<p>""<strong>the</strong> function f(x) is defined as ...""<br>
""<strong>the</strong> functions f(x) and g(x) are defined as ...""</p>

<p>but, on the other hand, one (almost) always reads:</p>

<p>""Point A is defined as ...""</p>

<p>""Points A and B are defined as ...""</p>

<p>Now, both ""point"" and ""function"" are countable nouns and, moreover, by saying ""f(x)"" and ""A"" you refer to a specific function or point.
So, why do I use <strong>""the"" in one case and zero article in another</strong>?</p>

<p>Another puzzling case is uncountable nouns such as ""conductance"" or ""energy"". You, basically, can find whatever situation. I take the next examples from the same article written by native English-speakers (and supposedly corrected by a language polishing service):</p>

<p>""<strong>the</strong> values of conductance are...""
""the dependence of <strong>the</strong> conductance at the neutrality point is...""
""<strong>The</strong> conductance G(E) is determined in a standard way..."" (notice the attribute G(E))</p>

<p>Can you help me to rationalize all this?</p>

<p>Finally, when you refer to a Figure/Table/Section/Equation/Chapter you always use zero article:</p>

<p>""As seen in equation 5 ...""
""..., which was shown in Section 3 ...""
etc.</p>

<p>Am I right?</p>

122201	What does “leaning in” mean as basic qualifications of women in the pursuit of positions in the workplace?	"<p>New York Times’ article written by Scott Schieman,  et al under the headline, “When Leaning in doesn’t pay off” starts with the following sentence;

<blockquote>
  <p>“Why do women not have as many leadership roles in the workplace as
  men do? Some have pointed to internal barriers, suggesting that the
  problem is partly attributable to something about women themselves,
  they are not “ambitious enough” at work, or are deeply committed to
  work but too hesitant to climb leadership ladders in organizations. -
  - - Sheryl Sandberg, in her now famous phrase, would have women “<strong>lean in</strong>,” to be more assertive at work and not let biases keep
  them from pushing forward. By leaning in, women would obtain more
  authority. </p>
  
  <p>To understand the claims embedded in the “<strong>lean in</strong>” hypothesis, we
  need to know why, when or how women decide to pursue positions of
  authority in the workplace.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I haven’t read Sheryl Sandberg’s book, I don’t know what she means by “lean in.” </p>

<p>Unfortunately none of Cambridge, Oxford, and Merriam Webster Dictionary includes “lean in” as an idiom, though all of them carry “lean on sb. / stg.”</p>

<p>What does “lean in” means? Does it mean stronger devotion to the work? In what instances is 'lean in' used as an idiom? Is “lean in” a neologism with specific implications /purposes invented by Sheryl Sandberg? </p>

<p>By the way:</p>

<p>Sheryl Sandberg’s ‘Lean In” is translated into Japanese by Yuko Kawamoto et al, published by Nihon Keizai Press, one of Japan’s leading newspapers known by the financial term, 'Nikkei Index' and a publisher recently, and widely read by Japanese businesswomen and men. It's becoming a best-seller. </p>

<p>The title and the word, ‘Lean In’ of the Japanese version are translated as “Make a step forward.” However, I wonder if “Make a step forward” exactly fits what Sandberg intends to convey and what you perceive with this word. </p>

<p>To me ""lean in"" and ""make a step forword""- there's the axiom in Zen, 'Make a stepfoward at the end of a cliff to get Satori (spiritual enlightment) - sound different as a physical action or posture, setting aside the state and level of mind.</p>

261445	Gerund or infinitive / Difference in meaning	"<p>In my classes, the subject of gerunds and infinitives comes up.  Students find this a confusing and frustrating subject.  They accept that one can say ""I like watching movies,"" or ""I like to watch movies,"" but they will usually ask, ""Which one should I use?""  This question makes sense.  I have seen most teachers answer this by saying ""It doesn't matter, they both mean th same thing.  Pick one that you like and use it.""</p>

<p>I feel that there is a difference and that as native English speakers we intuitively know the difference and will choose the expression that conveys our meaning.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I feel that this choice is language mirroring.  If someone asks you ""What do you like doing,"" you will probably answer with the gerund, ""I like watching.""  If they ask ""What do you like to do,"" you will probably answer ""I like to watch.""</p>

<p>However, if you say to someone ""Tell me about your interests,"" the person is free to answer, and some will give the gerund version and others will give the infinitive version.</p>

<p>My feeling is that infinitives express potential and gerunds express active things.  If you say ""I like to watch TV."" it means that this is something you like but don't really do it that much.  If you say ""I like watching TV."" it is probably something you do a lot.  On the flip side, you could also interpret ""I like watching TV."" as you like the activity but it doesn't mean you do it.  ""I like mountain climbing,"" doesn't necessarily mean that I do it, have done it, or will do it.</p>

261849	"So… ""whom I would trust"" OR ""who I would trust"" — which is correct?"	"<p>Consider the following two sentences:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(A) The man or woman has not been born yet whom I would trust to write
  error-free English.</p>
  
  <p>(B) The man or woman has not been born yet who would trust me to write
  error-free English.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In sentence (A), a nonexistent person is the subject of ""has"" and the object of ""trust"" in the relative clause, which begins with ""whom"". In sentence (B), our ghost is the subject of both the initial clause and the relative clause, which begins with ""who"". In (A), I am the subject of trust, whereas I am the object of it in (B)—hence the use of ""me"". </p>

<p>Since ""trust"" has the force to change ""I"" to ""me"" in (B), I believe it should also have the force to change ""who"" to ""whom"" in (A). Am I right or wrong, and why? Should a contact clause be used in (B) instead, and if so, why? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Having accepted the correct answer, I was right about ""whom"" being used in (A), but ""who"" could also be used in (A), in everyday speech and writing (informal contexts). The answer to my second question about the contact clause is probably no for (B) but yes for (A)! With a contact clause sentence (A) would read: ""The man or woman has not been born yet I would trust to write error-free English."" The relative pronoun can be removed in (A) because it's not the subject.</strong></p>

121088	How should pluralised inline code be highlighted?

121073	May I please help who(m)ever is next	"<p>I am bringing up a rather pedantic point here, but, one that has me completely stumped.  This is going to require some serious grammar knowledge.</p>

<p>I was in a line at a shop today and the teenager at the counter actually said ""May I please help <strong>whomever</strong> is next.""  As a matter of conversational English, I dare say, this construction borders on pretentious.  But, on deeper thought, it might be fine in formal English since the subject of the dependent clause should typically agree with the main clause.</p>

<p>But, then I found the <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/6923/can-i-help-whos-next#comment165075_6924"">following post</a> by Edwin Ashworth on this site regarding the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If one wants to be pedantic, the correct version uses whoever rather
  than whomever in this construction as, though the accusative is
  required to agree with the main clause (Can I help John? Can I help
  him? Can I help him who is next? NOT *Can I help he who is next? - see
  Fowler), the compound lexeme whoever fulfils a dual accusative
  (relating to the main clause)/nominative (relating to the relative
  clause) role. Whomever fulfils a double accusative role (Treat
  whomever the acid came into contact with).</p>
</blockquote>

"<p>I try my best to use proper sentence construction and punctuation, and for my amusement, I've taken the quest to find meaningful situations where one might use the various conjunctions at the beginning of sentences. I was told that ""because"" was the only one that's worthy of being placed at the start of a complete sentence. However, I've taught myself to challenge what I've been taught by attempting to discover flaws or contradictions in the logic. Along my journey, I've noticed that English is full of opposite words thus maintaining harmony and balance. By now, you should see where I'm heading with this idea; I've set out to find the inverse to the word ""because."" I know of the obvious examples that come to mind such as ""except,"" ""albeit,"" and ""not because."" None of these seemed to suit a universal role, though, but I believe I have discovered a solution, and I would like to know if this would be acceptable for use in sophisticated writing:</p>

<p>If you're wondering the source of the question, there is a game on Kickstarter right now called PooPride featuring human waste as protagonists. And given that it's a racing game, I imagine the name is meant to have a second meaning as Poop Ride.</p>

259714	How to translate the modern use of dutch term 'strippenkaart'	"<p>Originally, in the Netherlands, a 'strippenkaart' (literally 'stripescard') was a paper card with stripes one could use to travel. Each stripe was equivalent to a certain distance. If you wanted to travel on a bus or on a tram, depending on the distance you were going (counted in zones), a date/time stamp was placed on a particular stripe.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the original 'strippenkaart' for bus and tram has been replaced by a chip card which can be used for all public transport, but the term 'strippenkaart' is still used. </p>

<p>I think it can be defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You pay in advance for as many products that are on the card, but you 
  get a discount.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for example, if a coffee costs € 3,00 you can buy a 'strippenkaart' for 10 cups for € 25,50 (instead of € 30,-)</p>

<p>How would a card like that be called in English?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I am <strong>not</strong> talking about some kind of chip card, which holds some value equivalent to money, which can also be used for purchasing other things. It's more like a piece of paper with boxes that can be checked every time a purchase is made.</p>

<p>Also, I am looking for a more general term that can be used for all kinds of products. So you could have a 'strippenkaart' for cups of coffee, or haircuts etc.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.myenglishpages.com/site_php_files/grammar-lesson-articles.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myenglishpages.com/site_php_files/grammar-lesson-articles.php</a></p>

<p>Where ""the"" is explained as a word for a specific noun known to both speaker and the listener such as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bike was red.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However a number of the examples she was given(and were not really explained in the material she showed me) were of the form</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bike is one of the most efficient means of transportation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The squirrel is a small mammal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither of these examples are referring to a specific noun, they are referring to a generalization, ""The bike"" is true for every bike and the same for the squirrel example. Further to her confusion was that the sentences were not plural when referring to a generalization of ""every bike"" when she tried to correct the sentences as ""the bikes are"". </p>

<p>Would it be possible for someone to give me a explanation of this use or point me to something that has an explanation. I found it quite difficult to try and explain and the best I could come up with was that it's similar to ""The idea of a bike is. . ."" or ""The idea of a squirrel is. . ."" which I don't think is entirely accurate.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.

117599	"Setup or ""set up""?"	"<p>The word <em>setup</em> (as a noun), I feel, has become an acceptable part of the English language, at least insofar as technical manuals or computer textbooks are concerned. However I find that the word is used very often in verb form like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You can setup the program quite easily ...""</p>

<p>when in fact my understanding is that the actual sentence should be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You can set up the program quite easily ...""</p>

<p>I would like to know if <em>setup</em> can be used as a verb. The situation seems be very similar to the word <em>output</em> (as a noun). <em>Output</em> is a purely technical word and its use is restricted solely to technical texts or at least in a technical context within non-technical books. However it is also used in verb form now like so:</p>

<blockquote>

To me, the dry/hard stale and the soft/mushy stale are opposites of each other, but they are also opposites of fresh as well.</p>

<p>Now to give another example is apathy. The opposite of apathy is to feel strongly. Which could be both love and hate, which are both opposites of each other. I could love stale Oreos, I could hate stale Oreos, or I could feel completely apathetic about stale Oreos. All three of these seem to be mutually opposite of the other.</p>

<p>But also think of something too with things like sexism and racism and other political correctness where it's possible to go so over-corrective that it becomes its own offensive antithesis to both PC and non-PC alike. (I can't really think of a way to lighten this one with Oreos...)</p>

<p>I found the term <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autoantonym"" rel=""nofollow"">autoantonym</a> which seems to help a little bit with the relationship. I also know that in art and design you would call it a color triad where three colors are as far from each other on the spectrum as possible. However this still seems to come up short in trying to solve my existential Oreo issue...</p>

<p>*EDIT Ah! So let me add one last element to the question. In each instance where I think this situation could apply, I think we go from two words, A and B which appear to be binary opposites. It can either be A or not A. <em>But</em> when you add word/concept C which is both not A and not B, you either have a natural transition where it's possible to smoothly take the conversation to a broader or narrower scope (like emotions with love, hate and apathy). <em>OR</em> you could have a more unnatural transition where there isn't a clearly defined word for C (as far as I can tell there really isn't a word for that humid kind of stale. And that sad state of affairs really should have its own word, right?). And at the end of all this, it seems like we're trying to find a Word C even now... </p>

<p>EDIT. As noted in the comments and in the title: the question is indeed why <em>deep</em> and not <em>deeply</em>? Even if it does not feel too wrong, the second statement certainly confuses readers <em>deep</em>. Even if the use of <em>deep</em> as an adverb is widely accepted in formal speech, one does not expect to hear from the narrator in a novel.  [This is an adverb, right? Because like I said, I am confused.]</p>

<p>For rerefence, the rest of the sentence is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He began to breathe deep. He could feel himself breathing deep, as if
  each time his insides were afraid that next breath they would not be
  able to give far enough and that something terrible would happen, and
  that all the time he could look down at himself breathing, at his
  chest, and see no movement at all, like when dynamite first begins,
  gathers itself for the now Now NOW, the shape of the outside of the
  stick does not change; that the people who passed and looked at him
  could see no change: a small man you would not look at twice, that you
  would never believe he had done what he had done and felt what he had

<p>Particularly, I am looking for a word (synonym of 'study') which describes reading the research literature thoroughly (e.g. in order to review it), and getting the most out of it. </p>

<p>Actually I am writing a proposal for a software application to search and read research literature.

116108	"Are the expressions: ""You needn't"" and ""You don't need to"" different in meaning?"	"<p>While doing some research on a comment I had read on ELL I read the following excerpt from a website called <a href=""http://www.e-grammar.org/infinitive-gerund/"" rel=""nofollow"">e.grammar</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You needn't listen to him. (You don't have to listen to him.) x You
  don't need to listen to him. (There is no need to listen.) These two
  sentences are different in the form and meaning, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reflecting, I started interpreting the two sentences like this: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>""You needn't listen to him""</strong> = It is unnecessary to listen to that
man. If you want to listen that is your choice, but it's not
important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>""You don't <em>need</em> to listen to him""</strong> = It is not <em>necessary</em> to
listen to that man. If you do you will only be wasting your time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is the second sentence more forceful, perhaps precluding the possibility of choice? Or is my mind playing tricks on me and in reality the two phrases have identical meanings?</p>

<p>I must admit to feeling bemused. Before reading the passage I would have said there was no difference in meaning between <strong>needn't</strong> and <strong>don't need</strong>. On the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/learnit/learnitv317.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">BBC Learning English</a> I read this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Needn't and don't need to</strong>   </p>
  
  <p>There is also a difference in use when
  these verbs are used to describe present situations. We can use both
  <strong>needn't</strong> and <strong>don't need</strong> to to give permission to someone not to do
  something in the immediate future. We can also use <strong>need</strong> as a noun
  here:   </p>
  
  <p>You <strong>don't need</strong> to water the garden this evening. It's going to
  rain tonight.<br>
  You <strong>needn't</strong> water the garden this evening. It's going
  to rain tonight.<br>
  There's <strong>no need</strong> to water the garden this evening.
  It's going to rain tonight.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would confirm my initial belief; that there is no real difference in meaning but now... I'm not so sure. And if there is no difference, except for structure, why do the two forms exist side by side? Why or when did ""need"" become a modal verb?</p>

114963	Terminal comma?	"<p>I've always had this question but I didn't know the name for what I wanted to ask until just recently (figured it out while reading a tutorial for the Inform Interactive Fiction system). </p>

<p>When using commas in a list of things (see examples below) should there be a comma between the next-to-last item and the word ""and""? I think it makes more sense this way (see examples below).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example set 1:
       <pre>        I like squirrels, cheese, and typographic design.<br/>        I like squirrels, cheese and typographic design.</pre></blockquote></p>


<p>To me, the second method doesn't separate the two items, or indicate a pause (and the average reader would pause between ""and"" and ""typographic design"" regardless of whether the comma was there or not, right?). </p>

<p>The separation makes things clearer, in my opinion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example set 2:
       <pre>        I like squirrels, cheese, and mashed potatoes and gravy.<br/>        I like squirrels, cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy.</pre></p>
</blockquote>

<p><BR><br>It gets worse when the item containing ""and"" isn't the last item:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example set 3:</p>

<pre>        I like squirrels, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cheese.
        I like squirrels, mashed potatoes and gravy and cheese.
        I like squirrels, mashed potatoes, and gravy and cheese.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In the second sentence in set 2, the terminal comma (is that even the right term for it?) is removed, and in the third sentence in set 2, it is re-inserted, but in the wrong place, drastically altering the meaning of the sentence. Read aloud, the sentences probably sound about the same, but I think I like the extra clarity added by the terminal comma, but see many texts in which it is omitted. </p>

130059	Origin of 'Son of a Gun'	"<p>According to the OED a 'son of a gun' was a child born to a woman who accompanied her husband on a Royal Navy gunship. However I distinctly remember hearing on a BBC Radio 4 history programme that the 'sons of guns' were children born to 'ladies of easy virtue' with whom British sailors frequented in foreign ports. They would be allowed on to any subsequent ship to give birth, which happened on the gun-deck between the guns, and the ship's doctor would attend them. As no one took responsibility for fatherhood the child would be known as a 'son of a gun'. Wikipaedia is clearly unsure concerning these two possible origins.

<p>In math there are several different types of infinity, some of which are known as ""countable"" and others which are known as ""uncountable."" I have always heard that one should use fewer to denote instances where one can count the objects to compare and less when one cannot count the objects.

<p>Would it be proper for this student to say ""There are less integers than rational numbers,"" or should he say ""There are fewer integers than rational numbers""?

<p>Do the definitions of countable and uncountable make a difference in this case? Which would be the correct versions of these sentences?

<blockquote>

<p>That discusses the origins of words and various 'accents'. Yes, the examples are related, but my question is different and simple. I'm more keen on knowing if <em>Americans (today) use the leading h pronunciation (at large)?</em></p>

<p>Ever since I started my study of languages (my mother tongue included), I've tried to stick to a standard pronunciation from the dictionary. Thus in a way I look at the dictionary's pronunciation as the <em>right</em> way to pronounce words, regardless of what people really do. So now after seeing the leading h pronunciation related to Americans, I'm curious to know if they really do so.</p>

<p>And after the kind of responses and links I've seen on this subject today, I don't even think that an average non-academic American really knows this exists. Perhaps I'm wrong.</p>

<p>I know the former is more standard-conforming in most publications; however, I think the latter is more intuitive and meaningful.

127507	Why is the Christian god being spelled with a lowercase letter?	"<p>It's been going on for some time, but the phenomenon which was once seen as almost an act of <em>rebellion</em> is now becoming more commonplace. God, capitalized, is increasingly seen only at the start of a sentence. Leaving aside whether one believes in a god, or in the Christian God Himself, why is this convention not being criticized? </p>

<p>God is after all a proper noun, the name of a deity which for over 2,000 years we have all heard of, and know by that very name. It matters not that <em>god</em> or <em>God</em> may or may not exist. It is a name. And like any other name that belongs to a real person or a fictional character in a book, it ought to be spelled with a capital letter. </p>

<p>I always feel uncomfortable writing about God with a capital letter, I always feel there is a hoard of die-hard atheists ready to accuse me of being a creationist, god forbid. (Should that have been: ""..., God forbid""?)</p>

<p>Is the spelling of the Christian ""God"" politically incorrect?  Is God with a capital letter, grammatically speaking, an archaic tradition? And if so, why?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: From the answers so far posted, no one has yet mentioned the political and social consequences this deceptively innocent, lowercase spelling may have had on us, on today's society. And this has lead me wondering, whether in the history of the English language there has been anything similar; any linguistic <em>subversion</em>, spoken or written which was in reality a show of defiance toward an established authority such as a government or political leader.</p>

249052	"Does a ""fact"" have to be true?"	"<p>I'm struggling to decide whether to jettison use of the word <em>fact</em>, because the definition appears to be not solid enough to support continued usage. What do I mean by that? Look at one ""meaning ladder"" (taken from Random House via <a href=""http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fact"">TFD Online</a>) among several on the same page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>fact</strong><br>
  1. something that actually exists: <em>Your fears have no basis in fact.</em><br>
  2. something known to exist or to have happened.<br>
  3. a truth known by actual experience or observation; something known to be true.<br>
  4. something said to be true or supposed to have happened.<br>
  5. an actual or alleged event or circumstance, as distinguished from its legal effect or consequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition marches us from something that exists to something that is merely <em>supposed</em> to be true to something that may be ""actual or alleged."" (And yes, I am aware that dictionaries don't dictate the meanings of words; they record meanings from usages. And the meanings of this word <em>as it is used and recorded in English</em> seem to be antagonistic toward each other.) </p>

<p>What are we to do with all this? Does a fact require the modifier <em>true</em> to be judged genuine? When we preface a statement with ""in fact"" don't we mean <em>What follows is the truth</em>? The aforementioned dictionary certainly thinks so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>in fact</strong>, <strong>in truth</strong>; really; indeed: <em>They are, in fact, great patriots</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here <em>fact</em> and <em>truth</em> are equated absolutely. So I'm wondering: how do we distinguish between what is a fact in the sense of absolute truth and what is a fact of a lesser order? Other words can have many shades of meaning, but this one seems somehow like it shouldn't. So if I hear the word <em>fact</em> without hearing <em>true</em> before it, does it even deserve the term?</p>

<p><strong>A cautionary note</strong></p>

<p>I'm not really looking for a discussion of <em>truth</em> in the philosophical sense. The scope of this question is limited to the meaning of a word in English, not the meaning of an absolute concept as rational beings can or should understand it. What I'm really after, as I mentioned in a comment, is whether the adulteration of this particular word renders it, ultimately, meaningless, and therefore something to be avoided.</p>

<p>Are these two sentences grammatically correct under the condition that clock has recently stopped and its effect can still be seen ?
And under the condition that earthquake has recently come and its effect such as havoc all across the country can still be seen ?</p>

<p>Would the plural of the people German nationality ""the Germans"" or ""the German""? Is the ""s"" necessary to turn it into a plural noun? I have this question because I know that the plural of the people of Chinese nationality is ""the Chinese"" but not ""the Chineses.""</p>

<p>Is there any rule to this? If so, what would be the plural form for the people of Irish nationality or Indian nationality?</p>

246135	Punctuating a sentence containing em dashes within commas	"<p>I always find myself writing sentences that contain clauses within clauses, and I can never decide what the right way to punctuate this is. I'm not specifying what kinds of clauses because they could technically be several different kinds.</p>

<p>So here's an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I drove my little brother, Billy—the youngest of us, to the store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentence contains two appositives—one inside the other. Firstly, I know appositives are usually set inside commas, but I feel like nesting them calls for using multiple kinds of punctuation marks. Secondly, is this even the correct way to punctuate this sentence? I feel like it could also be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I drove my little brother, Billy—the youngest of us—to the store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might not be correct because now the sentence is broken up by just one comma which creates two incomplete sentences. If so, why is it not correct to say the first example is broken up by the lone em dash?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit for clarification:<br>
I'm pretty much asking if I can use the comma and em dash interchangeably here, and if so, which is better?</p>

246223	"Why isn't the nominative case generally used with ""to be""?"	"<p>In German, constructions with <em>sein</em>, which is uninflected infinitive meaning ""to me"", seem to generally use the nominative case. For instance, <em>this is a dog</em> translates to <em>das ist ein Hund</em>, and <em>ein</em> here is in the nominative. In German, <a href=""http://german.stackexchange.com/a/7632/8837"">this</a> seems related to what the subject of the sentence is.</p>

<p>In any case, I was thinking about this and wondered about why in constructions like <em>it is [inflected pronoun]</em>, using the nominative case for the pronoun instead of an objective case seems slightly overly formal.</p>

<p>That's not to say that the nominative case is never used. For instance, from the book of John:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, “Whom are you looking for?” They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus replied, “I am he.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This is from the New Revised Standard Version, but the King James Version gives the same.) Now, this seems grammatically correct to me, but it probably seem unnatural to the casual listener if, upon asking who Jane Doe is, I answered with ""I am she"" instead of ""I'm her.""</p>

<p>""Seller and Purchaser each warrants and represents that it has not engaged the services of any agent, finder or broker in connection with the transaction which is the subject of this Agreement....""</p>

<p>While it is true that ""each"" is always singular, the question is whether the word ""each"" can render the plural ""Seller and Purchaser"" singular by its inclusion in the sentence.</p>

<p>I believe the answer is no, based on the fact that if you replace ""Seller and Purchaser"" with the pronoun ""they,"" the sentence makes no sense:</p>

<p>""They each warrants and represents....""</p>

<p>But you can't simply remove the word ""each"" because then the sentence would imply that Seller and Purchaser warrant and represent on each other's behalf, which is clearly not the intent of the sentence either. So the answer, in my mind, is to break up the sentence into 2 separate sentences:</p>

"<p><em>Jootha</em> is a Hindi word which means that the food, which actually belongs to me has been tasted by someone else, without my permission. In India this is considered as a taboo and states that the food is not in its original intended state. </p>

<p>My friends suggested a few words like <em>preconsume</em> and <em>foreeat</em> which after some searching and user comments indicated were not correct English words.
The closest word that I found that conveyed a similar meaning was <strong><a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ort"" rel=""nofollow"">ort</a></strong>. It means <em>a scrap or morsel of food left at a meal</em>. But still this doesn't  convey the same meaning as clearly as the Hindi word.</p>

<p>Please suggest a word or a phase with which I can convey similar meaning as the Hindi word ""jootha"".</p>

For example -- Kate said that she is not well. ( Here non change in tense because Kate is still not well at the time of reporting.)</p>

246851	Use of 'cum' as the interstitial in a three-word semi-comparative adjective?	"<p>I have occasionally encountered and often written a three-word adjective of the form 'X-cum-Y' to describe a person, where the X and Y are normally set somewhat in tension with one another, if they are not outright contradictory states. I've seen this device used to denote character development; for example, if a nominally-celibate priest is discovered to have taken a lover, they might be described as a 'priest-cum-philanderer'.</p>

<p>Of course, given the euphemistic use of 'cum', such usage as I describe above has become rare (if it ever was common to begin with), but I am curious about it, regardless.</p>

<p>What is the function of what I call ""the interstitial 'cum'""? What is the history of its usage? Are there any rules or general guidelines for deploying it appropriately in prose?</p>

<p>I would be grateful for any information on the topic.</p>

  <p>3.) the study of historical linguistic change, especially as manifested in individual words.</p>

<p>Obviously the following sentence would be easily understood, but is it technically correct?  Or is there a better way to ask the following question?</p>

<p><strong><em>“What is the etymology of the Baseball term 'meat hand'?”</em></strong></p>

<p>As in a first-use, or how the phrase came to be, or what made it popular – etc.  What I think of as “etymology”, but perhaps that word is more technical, and specific to the linguistic breakdown and origins of individual words.</p>
