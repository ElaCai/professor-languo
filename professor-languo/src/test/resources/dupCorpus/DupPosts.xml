I was thinking about doing that in my bachelor thesis, but for now I am looking for your opinions, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Maybe the torque is the problem, because on tricopters you can can have all 3 props in 1 direction or 2 in 1 direction and 1 in the opposite and it's symmetrical in neither way, but I'm not sure if this is the main problem...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1602" LastEditorUserId="1602" LastEditDate="2013-07-08T03:22:54.580" LastActivityDate="2013-07-08T04:43:04.390" Title="Use of automated tricopters instead of quadcopters?"

<row Id="1174" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2013-04-08T02:12:39.543" Score="2" ViewCount="53" Body="&lt;p&gt;See the video below of my balancing robot.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjp8yoTVUcY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Balancing robot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was having trouble getting it to balance on hard surfaces but finally got it after playing with the PID gains a lot.  Previously it was balancing just fine on carpet.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I set the PID gains by just picking a Kp, then increasing Ki until the robot oscillated very badly and tried to smash it's self into the ground,  then increasing Kd until it was finally stable. Here's the gains I'm using in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Kp=20, Ki=4.5, Kd=45;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will sit in one spot balancing without any problem.  You can see in the video that it can even stop from falling after I give it a pretty good kick.  The problem is that it stops from falling over but then greatly overshoots the other direction.  In the video you can see when I give it just a small tap it runs the other way for a while before finally becoming stable again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions on what to try next?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="529" LastActivityDate="2013-04-08T02:12:39.543" Title="PID tuning to make my balancing robot better" Tags="&lt;pid&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="3" ClosedDate="2013-04-08T15:34:20.337" />

One of the task of this robot is to follow the wall. For the purpose I'm using a PID control system, where the reference is given from a ultrasonic sensor. So my problem here is im having a hard time tuning the PID. I know i can find the P coefficient pretty easily by plotting the desired set point range vs desired motor output speed. Even then the robot is not so stable, so i though of adding DI part of PID. But how do find out roughly the values of these coefficients without just trying out random values (manual tuning)? Thank you so much. Much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7278" LastActivityDate="2014-10-15T20:44:35.093" Title="PID Control Tuning" Tags="&lt;motor&gt;&lt;control&gt;&lt;pid&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="6" ClosedDate="2014-10-23T10:10:49.177" />
